					<dt id="faq-001">Do I have to set the <code>rendition:orientation</code> property?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No. The default setting does not constrain content to a single orientation. You can
							explicitly set the property to <code>auto</code> in the package document, but it does not
							change anything.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>EPUB 3 allows authors to lock fixed layout pages to a single orientation &#8212; either portrait or
					landscape &#8212; using the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#orientation"><code>rendition:orientation</code>
						property</a>. The problem with forcing a single orientation, however, is that it prevents users
					who cannot turn their device from being able to read the content.</p>
				
				<p>Users with physical and motor disabilities, for example, cannot always change the orientation of
					their device. The user may have it attached to a mount that cannot be adjusted, or that the user
					cannot adjust without assistance.</p>
				
				<p>By default, EPUB 3 fixed layout pages are not orientation constrained. Locking only occurs when the
					author explicitly sets the <code>rendition:orientation</code> property to the value
					<code>portrait</code> or <code>landscape</code>. Consequently, the simple solution to this WCAG
					level AA violation is to not set this property either globally or on specific pages.</p>
