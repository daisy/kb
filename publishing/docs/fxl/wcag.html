				<p>Although it may be possible to create fixed-layout EPUB publications that conform to WCAG 2.0,
					conforming to the latest versions of the standard is much more difficult due to the reflow
					requirement that was added in 2.1.</p>
				<p>The following table identifies some of the most common level A and AA success criteria that fail due
					to the use of fixed layouts.</p>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Success Criterion</th>
							<th>Required for WCAG</th>
							<th>Problems</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content (A)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Image-based fixed layouts, such as comics and manga, typically fail this requirement
									as alternative text and descriptions cannot capture all of the story conveyed
									through the imagery. A separate serialization of the story is often required.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and
									Relationships (A)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Generic elements, like <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> are often used to style
									and position text statically within a page, leaving the user with few structural
									aids to navigate the content (e.g., no headings, no tables).</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#meaningful-sequence">1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence
									(A)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Because content elements can be visually placed wherever needed, care is not always
									taken to ensure that a logical sequence is maintained in the markup. When an
									assistive technology reads such a work, information and dialogue are rendered out of
									sequence.</p>
								<p>In the case where content is laid out over two pages, the logical sequence may
									require a visual reader to move back and forth from page to page. This type of
									sequence cannot be represented in the markup.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#orientation">1.3.4 Orientation (AA)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Fixed-layout pages are usually designed to be rendered in a specific orientation, and
									authors may indicate that reading systems should only render the content in that
									orientation.</p>
								<p>To meet WCAG 2.0, however, the orientation of the content must not affect its
									readability.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>The overlaying of text on images in fixed layouts can cause insufficient contrast,
									making it difficult for readers to perceive the text.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text (AA)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.0+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Images of text are often used to prevent users from changing the font and altering
									the design of fixed-layout pages.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow (AA)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.1+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Due to the fixed dimensions of a fixed-layout page, the zoom requirement of this
									success criterion typically results in the user having to scroll both axes to read
									the content.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#text-spacing">1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)</a>
							</td>
							<td class="center">2.1+</td>
							<td>
								<p>Even if users are allowed to change the appearance, adding spacing can force text to
									exceed the boundaries of its container element and/or page. In this case, the
									overflow text is often hidden from sight.</p>
