				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>An unofficial way to create fixed-layout EPUB publications is to include images (excluding SVG)
					directly in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem"
						>package document spine</a>. This method of creating fixed layout pages is not commonly used,
					however, as images are not allowed in the spine without fallbacks, so in most cases it is simpler
					just to embed the image in either an <a href="html.html">XHTML</a> or <a href="svg.html">SVG</a>
					fixed layout page.</p>
				<p>When using images in the spine, no fixed-layout metadata is set as it will cause validation errors
					(e.g., because the required dimensions can only be determined from XHTML and SVG). It may even cause
					reading systems not to render the publication.</p>
				<p>A related problem is that by not being able to specify fixed-layout metadata, this method offers
					little control over the presentation of the pages. It also comes with severe <a href="#a11y"
						>accessibility problems</a>.</p>

				<h3>Creation</h3>
				<p>Putting images in the spine is no different than putting XHTML or SVG documents in the spine &#8212;
					an <code>itemref</code> element is used to refer to where the image is declared in the manifest:</p>
				<pre id="ex-01" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;package &#8230;>
   &#8230;
   &lt;manifest>
      &lt;item id="pg01" src="pg01.jpg" media-type="image/jpeg"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/manifest>
   &lt;spine>
      &lt;itemref ref="pg01"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/spine>
&lt;/package></code></pre>
				<p>If the preceding example were validated with <a href="../validation/epubcheck.html">EPUBCheck</a>,
					however, it would result in an error because JPEGs are not supported in the spine.</p>
				<p>To make the publication valid, a fallback to either an XHTML or SVG document must be specified on the
					manifest entry.</p>
				<pre id="ex-02" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;manifest>
   &lt;item id="pg01" src="pg01.jpg" media-type="image/jpeg" <strong>fallback="pg01-fb"</strong>/>
   &lt;item id="pg01-fb" src="pg01.xhtml" media-type="application/xhtml+xml"/>
   &#8230;
&lt;/manifest></code></pre>
				<p>If a reading system does not support images in the spine, it can now render the fallback XHTML page
					instead.</p>

				<h3>Accessibility</h3>
				<p>Images in the spine are the least accessible way of creating a fixed layout.</p>
				<p>There is no way to provide either alternative text or extended descriptions for the images without
					having to provide these through a fallback. As a result, if the reading system supports rendering
					the images, there will be no way for users to access the text alternatives (i.e., users are
					typically not provided the option to view fallbacks; the reading system automatically selects which
					to display). The result is that users of assistive technologies will hear nothing when the
					publication is read.</p>
				<p>Also, without any assurance that users can reach the alternative, it is also <strong>not
						possible</strong> to make a claim of WCAG conformance, even if the alternative would be
					conforming.</p>
				<p>To avoid the cost of creating a backup for every fixed layout page, a single fallback document that
					simply says the publication is not supported by the reading system might be used. This practice is
					basically as useless to readers as not providing text alternatives.</p>
				<p>Similarly, there may not be a one-to-one correlation between fixed layout pages and a text
					serialization of the content. In this case, it will not be possible for each page to have a fallback
					without confusing the reader somehow (e.g., if a series of pages fall back to the same text
					serialization, the reading system will keep rendering the text every time a page is turned).</p>
				<p>The use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-multi-rend/">multiple renditions</a> was
					intended to help solve the need for alternative serializations, but there is virtually no support
					for the specification.</p>
				<p>For these reasons, <a href="html.html">XHTML</a> and <a href="svg.html">SVG</a> fixed layout pages
					should always be preferred.</p>
