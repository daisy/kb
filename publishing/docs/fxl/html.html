				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Fixed-layout publications can be created using HTML documents to combine text and images. Each
					document is assigned a fixed height and width, the canvas on which the content is positioned. CSS is
					used to absolutely position content elements within this display area, or images are embedded in the
					page that fit the dimensions.</p>
				<p>The advantage of using HTML for fixed layouts is that it makes the text content of each page
					available to assistive technologies. In the case of images, it allows the native accessibility
					techniques HTML affords to be used to provide alternative text and extended descriptions.</p>

				<h3>EPUB</h3>
				<p>Although it is possible to create fixed layouts on the Web, they are not naturally supported by
					browsers. A browser will render the page as designed but not make any optimizations to support the
					rendering.</p>
				<p>To fix this problem for publishing, EPUB 3 introduced metadata to aid reading systems in creating the
					appropriate display area and characteristics for each fixed layout page.</p>
				<p>EPUB publications can consist entirely of fixed layout XHTML pages or there may only be a few fixed
					layout pages interspersed in a reflowable publication (e.g., a map might be included as a fixed
					layout in an otherwise reflowable publication).</p>
				<p>It is also possible to mix <a href="svg.html">fixed-layout SVG pages</a> with fixed-layout XHTML
					pages, or with <a href="img.html">images directly in the EPUB reading order</a>.</p>

				<h3>Accessibility</h3>
				<p>The same practices that make reflowable publications accessible are used to create fixed layout HTML
					pages with the greatest accessibility. Some key practices include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensuring the <a href="../html/order.html">logical reading order</a> &#8212; The order of content
						must match the order that the user would logically be expected to encounter it on the page. Use
						CSS to arrange the position on screen.</li>
					<li>Avoid splitting content across pages &#8212; although there are some methods to make <a
							href="spreads.html">page spreads</a> accessible, when supplementary information, like
						sidebars, are split across pages it makes retaining a logical reading order difficult.</li>
					<li>Using structural markup &#8212; Makes sure the content is marked up meaningfully so it can be
						navigated by assistive technologies. For example, use <a href="../html/tables.html">heading</a>
						and <a href="../html/tables.html">table</a> markup instead of styling content to look like these
						structures.</li>
					<li>Describing all meaningful <a href="http://localhost/publishing/docs/html/images.html">images</a>
						&#8212; All images that contain information necessary to understand the publication must be
						described using alternative text and/or extended descriptions. Background images often provide
						context for character interactions, so dialogue may not make sense without the scene
						setting.</li>
					<li>Avoiding images of text &#8212; Layering text over top of a background image makes it accessible
						to assistive technologies.</li>
					<li>Ensuring <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">text contrast</a> &#8212;
						Because fixed layouts often involve the layering of text over images, it is important to ensure
						that the text is visually distinguishable from its background.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Even when following these practices, a key problem that limits the accessibility of fixed layouts is
					that reading systems often lock out users from changing the appearance of the documents to preserve
					the author's layout (e.g., disabling the ability to increase font size or changing text color). As
					a result, even the best efforts to make a fixed-layout publication accessible may still leave it
					unreadable to some users.</p>
