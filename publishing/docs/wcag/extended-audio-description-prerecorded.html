				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users who are blind or visually impaired
					can access the non-visual content (e.g., the actions of individuals, changes in scene, etc.) of a
					video through an extended audio description track.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Meeting this success criterion is similar to <a href="audio-description-prerecorded.html">1.2.5</a>
					except that it requires the use of extended audio descriptions. An extended audio description track
					differs from a standard audio description track in that playback is paused, where necessary, to
					allow for more in-depth explanations than are possible between the natural breaks in the audio
					track.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion does not apply when it is possible to provide all the necessary information
					for the reader without pausing playback (i.e., through a standard audio description track).</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note">
					<p id="support-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Ebook formats typically do no support the use extended audio descriptions, so meeting this
						requirement is not practical in most cases.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on providing extended audio descriptions
					due to the lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG
						guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
