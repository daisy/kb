				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users of keyboards (and similar input devices)
					are not confused by not being able to locate focused elements that are hidden by other content in a
					document.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that focusable elements are not fully obscured by other content in the document.
					This problem is more common on web pages, where sticky headers and footers (i.e., that stay attached
					to the top or bottom of the page) can obscure content, or where non-modal dialogs (i.e., pop-ups that
					do not have to be dismissed to continue reading) overlay the text.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion does not apply when the user moves the content over the focused element (e.g.,
					in the case of pop-ups that can be dragged around). The requirement only requires that focusable elements
					not be obscured in the default position of such content.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on hidden focused content due to poor
					support for sticky headers and footers, and non-modal dialogs, in publishing formats.
					Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
