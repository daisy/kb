				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users have a chance to correct errors in
					their data and/or review the data before it is submitted to a server that would store it.
					Alternatively, users need to be provided the ability to undo their submission.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>This success criterion will most commonly only apply to tests, as digital publications do not
					typically collect legal and financial data.</p>
				
				<p>Digital textbooks may sometimes contain tests that are submitted to a remote server (e.g., a school
					course portal). In these cases, authors need to either validate the input and allow users to
					correct any errors before submitting or provide users with the change to confirm their input.
					Ideally, both options would be provided.</p>
				
				<p>If undoing a submission is the only way to meet this criterion, finding an alternative means than
					the publication is recommended. For example, a user might be able to undo their submission from
					a course portal until the duration they have been given to complete the test expires.</p>
				
				<p>Note that the success criterion only applies if the data is transferred and stored on a remote
					server. Quizzes and other embedded tests that only run within a digital publication are not subject
					to these requirements.</p>
