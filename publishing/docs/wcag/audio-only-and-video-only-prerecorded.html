				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users who cannot hear audio clips or see
					videos clips still have access to the information conveyed by this content.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>For both audio and video clips, the author typically must include a transcript.</p>
				
				<p>For audio clips, the transcript must identify the speakers and what they are saying.</p>
				
				<p>For video clips, in addition to any text presented during the clip, the transcript also must
					identify any characters and the actions they perform.</p>
				
				<p>Another alternative for video is to provide an audio track that describes the video.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note">
					<p id="support-note" class="label">Note</p>
					
					<p>This success criterion only applies to video without audio. An example is an instructional
						animation that shows the steps to carry out but does not narrate them. For making video with an
						audio track accessible, refer to <a href="captions-prerecorded.html">Captions
							(Prerecorded)</a></p>
