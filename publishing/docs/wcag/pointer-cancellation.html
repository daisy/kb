				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to help users avoid accidental pointer input.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors have three options to meet this success criterion. The first is to ensure that any events
					initiated by a pointer such as a mouse do not occur on a down click unless they are essential to
					the functioning of the content.</p>
				
				<p>Second is to provide the ability to abort or undo the action. For example, moving the pointer away
					from a button before releasing to prevent it from activating.</p>
				
				<p>Third is to use an up event to cancel the action of a down event. An example would be holding a mouse
					button down to keep a dialog open and only closing it once the button is released.</p>
