				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can easily locate controls.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>The use of hidden controls is not common in digital publications because these works are typically
					read on devices without hover or keyboard interfaces. Controls are typically persistent so that
					they can work with touch devices.</p>
				
				<p>If authors do create interfaces with hidden controls, however, they need to ensure that users can
					access persistent versions. This could be by allowing the user to make the hidden controls
					persistent (e.g., through a toggle) or by providing a persistent version of the control at some
					stage of interaction (e.g., making the controls persistent once the interface is activated).</p>

			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on control visibility due to the lack of
					implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a>
					for additional information.</p>
