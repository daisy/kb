				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that readers with low vision can read a
					publication without having to scroll in two dimensions when zooming the content to 400%.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that as their publications are zoomed the content reflows to fit the
					available area (e.g., the content is not clipped by the edge of the page). Users should not have to
					scroll to read a line of text (e.g., scrolling from side-to-side to read text that is read
					horizontally, or top-to-bottom for text that read vertically).</p>
				
				<p>For reflowable EPUBs, this usually only requires techniques that force content into a fixed area.
					Examples include using absolute units of measure such as pixels so that container elements cannot
					resize into the available space and using static layouts such as design tables that cannot adapt
					as the screen space shrinks.</p>
				
				<p>Meeting this requirement for fixed layouts is much more complicated depending on the type of
					content. Image-based content, where the presentation is essential to the understanding (e.g.,
					comics and manga) are exempt from the requirement, but all other fixed layouts are not. But as EPUB
					reading systems do not re-render pages as they are zoomed, only increase the magnification, nothing
					an author does will make these publications accessible (i.e., scrolling is unavoidable).</p>
				
				<p>Note that this success criterion only applies to desktop computers with a screen resolution of
					1082px by 1024px. It is not required that the content be zoomable to 400% on mobile devices of any
					screen resolution.</p>
