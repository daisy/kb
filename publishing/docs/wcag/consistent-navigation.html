				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to provide consistency in how users encounter repeated
					navigation content so that users can predict where the navigation information is and what
					they will have access to.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>This success criterion is generally not applicable to publications, as publications rarely have
					repeated navigation features at the top of each document like web sites do.</p>
				
				<p>If this situation does arise in a publication, authors need to ensure that the navigation aids
					do not change order or position from document to document.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on consistent navigation due to the lack of
					applicability to publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a>
					for additional information.</p>
