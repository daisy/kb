				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users who cannot perceive the content can
					still follow the logical reading ordering of the publication (i.e., the visual sequencing of the
					content does not change the primary narrative).</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>This success criterion mostly commonly affects fixed-layout publications where authors can use CSS
					to position content in a different sequence visually. Dialogue, for example, can be misordered in
					the markup but made to read logically visually.</p>
				
				<p>Therefore, to meet this success criterion, the order of content in the markup must match the
					expected reading order.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion applies across page boundaries, as the narrative continues from
					document to document. Sidebars, images, tables and other content split across documents has
					to make sense from page to page, not just within the document that contains it.</p>
				
				<p>For example, consider a sidebar split across the bottom of two pages. If the markup for each part of
					the sidebar is the last item in each document, users will struggle to follow the text from document
					to document. In a case like this, the portion of the sidebar on the second page should be ordered
					first so that a reader who starts reading it on the first page can continue reading it to its
					conclusion immediately on the second. The author can then visually style the location to match with
					the preceding page's layout.</p>
