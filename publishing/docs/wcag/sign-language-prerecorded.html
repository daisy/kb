				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users whose primary means of communication
					is a sign language can access the auditory content of videos. Written text is not always as easily
					followed by such users, increasing the difficulty to understand auditory content.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>To meet this success criterion, authors must provide synchronized sign language interpretation
					for the auditory content of any videos used in their publications.</p>
				
				<p>Sign language interpretation typically has to be included in the video stream due to the
					complexity of synchronizing separate videos.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on adding prerecorded sign language
					interpretation. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional
					information.</p>
