				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion was to ensure that critical markup errors do not cause user
					agents and assistive technologies to interpret documents differently. It was primarily aimed at
					HTML content, as XML has a rigid parsing model that often results in pages with errors not
					rendering for any users (i.e., errors are general usability issues, not specifically
					accessibility ones).</p>
				
				<p>Since the HTML standard now defines an algorithm for correcting mistagged content, this success
					criterion no longer applies to its original case.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note2">
					<p id="support-note2" class="label">Note</p>
					
					<p>The change to success criterion 4.1.1 still has to work its way through the W3C publishing
						process. It is not yet official. As XHTML is far more significant to EPUB, and already
						captures the parts of the success criterion not covered elsewhere in WCAG, the knowledge base
						and SMART checker assume the change will be enacted.</p>

				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>All HTML and XML-based content passes this success criterion. No evaluation steps are required.</p>
				
				<p>It is, however, still strongly recommended to validate all digital publications for markup errors
					and warnings. This step may still capture accessibility issues related to other success criteria.
					For example, duplicate IDs are an accessibility problem when they break the use of ARIA attributes
					for custom controls, prevent users from reaching linked descriptions, break skip to content links,
					etc.</p>
				
				<p>The following table provides an overview of parsing errors that affect the accessibility of digital
					publications as well as which success criteria they should be reported under:</p>
				
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Issue</th>
							<th>Report under</th>

							<td>More than one <code>role</code> attribute on an element with conflicting values</td>
