				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that components that have the same functionality
					are identified consistently so users can anticipate their use.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that they use consistent naming practices for any components that are
					repeated across documents. For example, if the same icon is used to identify a certain type of
					sidebar, the label for the icon must not change from document to document. Similarly, if an
					image is used to identify extended descriptions, the label for the image must not change.</p>
				
				<p>Note that it is not required that the components have identical labels to meet this success
					criterion. Some parts of the label may be document-specific so long as the general naming
					pattern is the same (e.g., an icon for extended descriptions might always start with "Extended
					description for" but be follow by the specific figure number for the image).</p>
				
				<p>Note that this success criterion only applies across a set of documents. If an EPUB Publication
					only consists of a single document, then technically this success criterion does not apply.</p>
