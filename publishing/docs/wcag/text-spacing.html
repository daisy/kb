				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can increase the spacing of text 
					to improve its readability without losing content or functionality.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that when all the listed settings are applied to the publication, the content
					remains readable and functional.</p>
				
				<p>Some problems that arise when spacing is increased include text being clipped by its containing
					element, text overlapping nearby content, and buttons being pushed off screen.</p>
				
				<p>To avoid these problems, authors need to use flexible design patterns and/or ensure that there is
					enough space within elements to meet the spacing minimums.</p>

					criterion for publishing content:</p>
