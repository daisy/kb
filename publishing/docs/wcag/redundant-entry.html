				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users with cognitive disabilities do not
					have to unnecessarily re-enter the same information to complete a multi-step process.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>As it is not common for digital publications to include multi-step processes, this success criterion
					rarely applies.</p>
				
				<p>If authors include multi-step processes, they need to ensure that if the user inputs information
					in a previous step, and it has to be specified again, the information is auto-populated or the
					use can select to include it again.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on redundant entry due to the lack of
					implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a>
					for additional information.</p>
