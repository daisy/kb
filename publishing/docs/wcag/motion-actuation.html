				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can perform actions based on the
					movement of a device using more conventional controls, as not all users can physically manipulate
					their devices.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>If a publication contains games or activities that are operated by the user tilting, shaking, or
					similarly physically manipulating their device, the same functionality is available using 
					conventional user controls such as buttons, sliders, etc.</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently cover the creation of accessible input modalities.
					Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
