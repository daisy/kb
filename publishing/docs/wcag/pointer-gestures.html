				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of the success criterion is to ensure that users have an alternative to performing
					complex pointer gestures to control the content, as not all users are able to perform these
					types of operations.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that alternative control methods are available when interactive content
					requires a user to follow a specific path (e.g., not just drag an item from one spot and drop
					it in another but move through specific intermediary points) or requires multipoint gestures
					(e.g., where two or more fingers are required to tap a screen for an action to occur).</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently cover the creation of accessible input modalities.
					Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
