				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users with cognitive disabilities can
					authenticate themselves when cognitive function tests &#8212; such as password input, memorization,
					puzzle solving, and calculations &#8212; are used to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>As it is not common for digital publications to authenticate users, this success criterion rarely
					applies (authentication is usually done by the user agent).</p>
				
				<p>If authors use authentication forms with cognitive function tests to secure access to some part of
					a publication, however, they need to ensure there is an alternative that does not rely on a
					functional test, a means of helping users with the test, or the test only requires recognition of
					objects or content provided by the user.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on accessible authentication due to the
					lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance
						documents</a> for additional information.</p>
