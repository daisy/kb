				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that user that require a keyboard to access a
					publication have access to all functionality in the content, except where the required input cannot
					be replicated by keyboard.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that all controls and links are accessible by keyboard input and that the
					input is not time-based (e.g., that users must press keys a certain number of times or for a
					specific length of time to register).</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion typically applies to custom controls and links that authors create through
					scripting. Native HTML elements for these functions are generally accessible, with authors only
					needing to ensure that they are clearly labeled.</p>
				
				<p>Note that this success criterion does not apply to functionality where the full path of action is
					important, as keyboards typically cannot replicate this functionality. An example would be an
					embedded program that allows users to freehand draw.</p>
