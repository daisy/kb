				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users are aware how much time there is before
					a timeout will occur (i.e., their data is lost), as readers with cognitive disabilities, for example,
					may require additional time to read, understand and interact with the content.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>The use of timeouts in digital publications is not common, as timeouts are usually included on the
					web as a security measure (i.e., to close a user's session in case they forgot to log out when they
					quit).</p>
				
				<p>If authors do include a timeout (e.g., in an embedded game or application), they need to ensure that
					users are aware before they begin interacting with the content how long they have before the timeout
					occurs. The length of time before a timeout could be provided in the instructions for a game, for
					example.</p>
				
				<p>In general, however, it is best to avoid timeouts unless there is a specific security concern.</p>
