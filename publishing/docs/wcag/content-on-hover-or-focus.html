				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can control the display of information
					that appears on a hover or focus event so that it does not interfere with their ability to read
					the content beneath.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>When authors add content that appears on a hover or focus event, they need to ensure that each of
					the requirements of the success criterion are satisfied.</p>
				
				<p>As digital publications are rarely designed to be read by users with pointing devices and keyboards,
					this success criterion is generally not applicable. The closest analogy in publications are pop-up
					footnotes, but these do not fall under this success criterion both because they are generated by
					reading systems and because they typically require a click event to appear.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on displaying content in response to hover
					and focus events due the lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a 
						href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
