				<p>This page is an archive of changes to the knowledge base made in 2024. For the latest changes

				<p>Changes are listed from most recent to oldest.</p>
				
				<dl class="value">
					<dt>December 11, 2024 — MathML caution removed</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The caution about using MathML has been removed as support for MathML rendering continues to
							improve.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>September 19, 2024 — New pages for QR codes</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although QR codes are most often associated with getting people from physical to digital media,
							they are starting to appear in digital publications. QR codes can be helpful for devices that
							are not connected to the internet, but they need to be created accessibly to be useful to the
							greatest number of readers. The knowledge base now includes a page covering best practices for
							<a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/images-qr.html">QR codes</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>March 28, 2024 — New pages for accessibility features</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The knowledge base now includes separate pages for each of the schema.org 
							<code>accessibilityFeature</code> values. As the list of these values grows, maintaining
							their explanations in a single page has made discovering information about them more cumbersome.
							By breaking them out into separate pages, each value now includes more information and examples.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>March 21, 2024 — New pages on setting the text direction</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The knowledge base now includes two new pages covering the use of the <code>dir</code> attribute
							to set the base direction for text in the <a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/epub/dir.html">package document</a> and in 
							<a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/dir.html">HTML documents</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>February 22, 2024 — Expanded guidance on page navigation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The page on page navigation is now split in four:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/navigation/pagenav.html">Overview</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/navigation/pagebreaks.html">Page Breaks</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/navigation/pagelist.html">Page List</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/navigation/pagesrc.html">Page Source</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>These pages provide additional context on their respective topics, as well as update and expand
							on the examples and frequently asked questions.</p>
						
						<p>Some of the new issues covered include not adding page breaks to headings, how to identify the
							source of pagination when the source does not have a unique identifier, and that preference
							should now be given to the <code>pageBreakSource</code> property.</p>
