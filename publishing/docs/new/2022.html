					<dt>November 8, 2022 &#8212; WCAG 2.2 Explainers</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="../wcag/">WCAG explainers</a> now reflect changes made as WCAG 2.2 transitioned
							from a working draft to a candidate recommendation. These include adding pages for
							<a href="../wcag/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> 
							and <a href="../wcag/focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a>
							success criteria and consolidating <a
								href="../wcag/focus-appearance.html">Focus Appearance</a> to a single success criterion.</p>
						<p>The pages for Visual Indicators and Page Break Navigation now include warnings
							that they will be removed from the KB as they were dropped from WCAG 2.2.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>September 7, 2022 &#8212; Poetry</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new page is now available discussing techniques for <a href="../html/poetry.html">marking
							up lines of verse</a> using the capabilities that HTML offers.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 30, 2022 &#8212; Text-based images</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new page is now available discussing techniques for <a 
							href="../html/images-text-based.html">making text-based images accessible</a>. These
							include not only ASCII art and emoticons, but also visual components such as redacted
							text spans and the spaces for answering fill-in-the-blank questions.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 19, 2022 &#8212; Image selection</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new page is now available discussing the options the HTML <code>picture</code>

								different images for different device capabilities</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 17, 2022 &#8212; Sections and landmarks</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Added additional emphasis to the <a href="../html/sections.html">Sections page</a>
							that not every <code>section</code> element needs to be identified as a landmark.
							The list of landmarks is not intended to be an alternative to a table of contents,
							and too many landmarks reduces its usability.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 16, 2022 &#8212; Accessibility summaries</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specification has changed the inclusion of summaries from
							a requirement to a recommendation and provided new guidance on not using the property
							to repeat the other discovery metadata. Pages cover the inclusion of summaries are
							now up to date with this guidance.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 25, 2022 &#8212; Tables</dt>
					<dd>

							information about accessible markup practices. The new pages are: <a

									href="../html/tables-headers.html">Complex Headers</a>, <a
										href="../html/tables-scope.html">Headers Scope</a>, <a 
											href="../html/tables-layout.html">Layout Tables</a>, <a 
												href="../html/tables-captions.html">Table Captions</a> and <a 
													href="../html/tables-summary.html">Table Summaries</a>. These pages are located
							on the Topics page under the HTML section's <a href="../topics.html#html-tables">Tables
								subheading</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 14, 2022 &#8212; Asides and articles</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>New dedicated pages covering the HTML <a href="../html/asides.html"><code>aside</code></a>
							and <a href="../html/articles.html"><code>article</code></a> elements are now available.
							These elements were previously only generally mentioned in the <a 
								href="../html/sections.html">Sections page</a>, which remains focused on the 
							<code>section</code> element.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 7, 2022 &#8212; Quoted text</dt>

					<dd>
						<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to help make the site easier for users to navigate, the <a 
							href="../topics.html">main topics page</a> and each category index now include brief 
							descriptions. These descriptions introduce the categories and explain what each topic
							page covers.</p>

							available by clicking on the  "Topics" link in the site menu bar.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>June 17, 2022 &#8212; Updated the list of ONIX Code List 196 values</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="../metadata/onix/">page on ONIX metadata</a> now includes descriptions for
							the new values 25 through 29 and 93. These cover the use of color, contrast, and audio, the
							inclusion of prerecorded audio descriptions, previous/next heading navigation, and how to

						<p>In anticipation of EPUB 3.3 moving to a W3C Candidate Recommendation in the next couple
							of weeks, all links to older versions of EPUB 3 have been updated. The changes in the
							EPUB 3.3 specification do not affect the guidance in this site, but the new specification
							is easier to read and includes many clarifications.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>April 30, 2022 &#8212; Redesigned pages</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The topic pages have been redesigned to make them easier to read. The table of contents for
							each page is now available in a sidebar rather than compressed on a single line beneath the
							page title. The breadcrumb has been replaced by a category heading above each title.
							Clicking on the category will take you to a list of all topics for that category. Finally,
							a "Topics" link is now available in the main menu bar to return to the home page.
							Previously, you had to click the site title to return.</p>
					</dd>
