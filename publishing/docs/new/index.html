					<dt>July 25, 2022 &#8212; Tables</dt>

						<p>The page on HTML tables has been split into six new pages to provide more detailed
							information about accessible markup practices. The new pages are: <a
								href="../html/tables-basics.html">Table Basics</a>, <a 
									href="../html/tables-headers.html">Complex Headers</a>, <a
									href="../html/tables-scope.html">Headers Scope</a>, <a 
									href="../html/tables-layout.html">Layout Tables</a>, <a 
									href="../html/tables-captions.html">Table Captions</a> and <a 
									href="../html/tables-summary.html">Table Summaries</a>. These pages are located
							on the Topics page under the HTML section's <a href="../topics.html#html-tables">Tables
								subheading</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 14, 2022 &#8212; Asides and articles</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>New dedicated pages covering the HTML <a href="../html/asides.html"><code>aside</code></a>
							and <a href="../html/articles.html"><code>article</code></a> elements are now available.
							These elements were previously only generally mentioned in the <a 
								href="../html/sections.html">Sections page</a>, which remains focused on the 
							<code>section</code> element.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 7, 2022 &#8212; Quoted text</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new page explaining techniques for <a 
							href="../html/quotes.html">quoting text from another source</a> is now available.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>June 29, 2022 &#8212; Topic descriptions</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to help make the site easier for users to navigate, the <a 
							href="../topics.html">main topics page</a> and each category index now include brief 
							descriptions. These descriptions introduce the categories and explain what each topic
							page covers.</p>
						<p>For users who prefer a terser listing, the descriptions on the main topics page can be
							turned off by deselecting the "Show descriptions" checkbox.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>June 23, 2022 &#8212; New home page</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new home page for the site is now live. The page is to help new users arriving at
							the site discover more information about the knowledge base. The topical index is still 
							available by clicking on the  "Topics" link in the site menu bar.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>June 17, 2022 &#8212; Updated the list of ONIX Code List 196 values</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="../metadata/onix.html">page on ONIX metadata</a> now includes descriptions for
							the new values 25 through 29 and 93. These cover the use of color, contrast, and audio, the
							inclusion of prerecorded audio descriptions, previous/next heading navigation, and how to
							identify the organization that performed conformance testing.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 11, 2022 &#8212; New location for "Applies To" information</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Information about what formats topics apply to is now included in the body of each page. The
							"Applies To" section includes a table listing support in various formats.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 10, 2022 &#8212; Redesigned techniques</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>To help improve the readability of the techniques sections, the links to WCAG documentation
							have been moved to the <a href="../wcag/index.html">WCAG explainer pages</a>. To access the
							WCAG explainer for a technique, you can now click on the success criteria numbers at the end
							of the list items.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 4, 2022 &#8212; Updated EPUB 3 specification links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In anticipation of EPUB 3.3 moving to a W3C Candidate Recommendation in the next couple
							of weeks, all links to older versions of EPUB 3 have been updated. The changes in the
							EPUB 3.3 specification do not affect the guidance in this site, but the new specification
							is easier to read and includes many clarifications.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>April 30, 2022 &#8212; Redesigned pages</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The topic pages have been redesigned to make them easier to read. The table of contents for
							each page is now available in a sidebar rather than compressed on a single line beneath the
							page title. The breadcrumb has been replaced by a category heading above each title.
							Clicking on the category will take you to a list of all topics for that category. Finally,
							a "Topics" link is now available in the main menu bar to return to the home page.
							Previously, you had to click the site title to return.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>February 7, 2022 &#8212; New ARIA accessibility feature</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a 
							href="../metadata/schema.org/accessibilityFeature.html"><code>accessibilityFeature</code>
							page</a> now includes the newly added "ARIA" value for indicating that a publication makes
							use of ARIA document structure and landmark roles to improve its structure and
							navigation.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>February 4, 2022 &#8212; Deprecated DPUB-ARIA roles</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The pages describing the <a 
							href="../html/dpub-aria/doc-biblioentry.html"><code>doc-biblioentry</code></a> and 
							<a href="../html/dpub-aria/doc-endnote.html"><code>doc-endnote</code></a> roles
							have been updated to reflect that their use will be deprecated in the DPUB-ARIA 1.1
							specification.</p>
