				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the internationally recognized standard for
					creating accessible Web-based content.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The WCAG guidelines take a layered approach to accessibility, starting with four high-level
						<em>principles</em> that all content creators should strive to achieve. These principles are
					defined as follows:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#perceivable">Perceivable</a> &#8212; Information and user
						interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#operable">Operable</a> &#8212; User interface components
						and navigation must be operable.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#understandable">Understandable</a> &#8212; Information and
						the operation of user interface must be understandable.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#robust">Robust</a> &#8212; Content must be robust enough
						that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive
						technologies.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>At the next level, each of these principles is broken down into a set of <em>guidelines</em> for
					achieving compliance.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>1. Perceivable</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol class="none" role="list">
							<li>1.1 Text Alternatives</li>
							<li>1.2 Time-based Media.</li>
							<li>1.3 Adaptable</li>
							<li>1.4 Distinguishable</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>
					<dt>2. Operable</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol class="none" role="list">
							<li>2.1 Keyboard Accessible</li>
							<li>2.2 Enough Time</li>
							<li>2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions</li>
							<li>2.4 Navigable</li>
							<li>2.5 Input Modalities</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>
					<dt>3. Understandable</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol class="none" role="list">
							<li>3.1 Readable</li>
							<li>3.2 Predictable</li>
							<li>3.3 Input Assistance</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>
					<dt>4. Robust</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol class="none" role="list">
							<li>4.1 Compatible</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>A further level below the guidelines are the <em>success criteria</em>, which is the level where WCAG
					moves from a general outline for accessible content to how to practically achieve it. These criteria
					are quite extensive, so are not reproduced here. For more information, refer to the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/">WCAG guidelines</a>.</p>

				<p>After these three levels of progressive refinement of what it takes to create accessible content, you
					reach the <em>sufficient and advisory techniques</em> for testing compliance to the success
					criteria. These criteria provide the format-specific information you need to verify your
					content.</p>

				<p>This knowledge base focuses on the techniques for publishing, in particular as they relate to meeting
					the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/">EPUB Accessibility specification</a>, but understanding
					the higher-level concepts is also necessary to truly understand what makes content accessible. You
					will find links to the relevant techniques throughout this site, while the introductions to each
					section endeavour to explain why making these structures accessible is necessary (i.e., how they fit
					into the higher-level guidelines).</p>

			<section id="conformance">
				<h3>Conformance</h3>

				<p>WCAG defines three levels of conformance (from 'A' to 'AAA') to indicate the breadth of support a
					site provides.</p>

				<p>Level A is the minimal accessibility baseline that documents must meet, but at this level they will
					likely remain problematic for their target audiences. Level AA is commonly considered the actual
					baseline that documents must meet in order to be considered accessible.</p>

				<p>Note that in order to meet Level AA, all of the requirements of Level A must be met. Each higher
					level of conformance builds on the levels below it.</p>

				<p>Level AAA is widely regarded as aspirational, as it is typically not possible for documents to meet
					all of the requirements. Authors should not ignore the success criteria at this level, but may defer
					requirements that are too complicated to achieve.</p>
