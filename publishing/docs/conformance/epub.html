				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y">EPUB Accessibility specification</a> defines
					discoverability requirements and accessibility conformance for <a>EPUB publications</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>As EPUB is built on Open Web Platform technologies, like HTML and CSS, the EPUB Accessibility
					specification builds on the <a href="wcag.html">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> to
					define accessibility conformance for EPUB publications.</p>

				<p>The primary advantage of this approach to accessibility is that it keeps EPUB aligned with the body
					of work that has already been done to make web content accessible. It also immediately makes web
					content accessibility specialists knowledgeable about the issues involved in ebook production. And,
					more generally, it means that content creators seeking to discover how to make their publications
					more accessible have a wealth of general resources available to them beyond this knowledge base.</p>

				<p>But EPUB is also its own unique format, and WCAG is not a simple blanket set of practices that all
					apply in every situation. The knowledge base aims to bridge this gap for EPUB content by focusing on
					how to make rich publications that adhere to WCAG. Unlike the general web, where each site's design
					often brings its own unique issues, books are more often composed of the same sets of building
					blocks, making accessibility mappings useful to a broad range of publishers.</p>

			<section id="conformance">
				<h3>Conformance</h3>

				<p>The EPUB Accessibility specification defines three key areas for conformance:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>1. Discoverability</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-discovery">discovery section of the
								specification</a> identifies <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility"
								>schema.org accessibility metadata</a> that has to be included in the EPUB package
							document.</p>

						<p>It is required that all publications include the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>A summary describing their accessibility in human-readable language.</li>
							<li>A list of all accessibility features.</li>
							<li>The modes in which the content is expressed (e.g., textual, visual).</li>
							<li>Any potential physical hazards the content might present (e.g., risk of seizure).</li>
						</ul>

						<p>A more complete overview of this metadata is provided in the <a
							href="../metadata/schema-org.html">Schema.org Metadata</a> section of this knowledge base.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of this metadata allows EPUB publications to be self-descriptive about their
							accessibility conformance, or lack thereof.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>2. Accesibility</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-access-pub">accessibility section of the
								specification</a> describes content conformance requirements. These requirements break
							down into two sections:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>WCAG Conformance</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>EPUB publications must meet <a href="wcag.html">WCAG</a> Level A or AA in order to
									conform to the specification, with AA being the recommended conformance level.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>EPUB-specific Conformance</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The specification defines two conformance criteria that are currently specific to
									EPUB: <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-page-nav">page navigation</a> and
										<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-mo">synchronized media
									playback</a>.</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>

					<dt>3. Optimizations</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A third section of the specification deals with "<a
								href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-opt-pubs">optimized publications</a>". These
							are publications that do not meet the WCAG definition of being widely accessible but that
							are optimized for users with very specific needs. An example of this type of publication is
							an audio book. Audio books are accessible for persons who are blind, for example, but not
							for the deaf. Optimized publications are expected to conform to a standard for their target
							audience, but the accessibility specification does not specify these standards (i.e., this
							conformance is outside the scope of the specification).</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

			<section id="reporting">
				<h3>Reporting</h3>

				<p>The accessibility specification defines the following <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-conf-reporting">reporting metadata for EPUB
						publications</a>:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What version of the specification and what <a href="wcag.html">WCAG</a> level was met.</li>
					<li>Who evaluated the publication.</li>
					<li>What credentials the evaluator has, if any.</li>
					<li>Where to find a more in-depth evaluation report.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>A complete listing of this metadata and how to use it is provided in the <a
						href="../metadata/evaluation.html">Evaluation Metadata</a> section of this knowledge base.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="distribution">
				<h3>Distribution</h3>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-distribution">distribution section of the
						specification</a> dives into issues in the distribution chain that can limit the accessiblity of
					a publication.</p>

				<p>The most important of these issues is to not apply digital rights management schemes to a publication
					that limit access to the content. When this occurs, a perfectly accessible publication might no
					longer be readable at all if, for example, assistive technologies are prevented from reading out the
					text.</p>

				<p>The other requirement is to provide accessibility metadata in whatever format a vendor uses to ingest
					the publication. It is common in trade publishing, for example, for ONIX records to be provided to
					distributors, which is also where they will harvest metadata about the publication. If the ONIX
					accessibility fields are not completed, users may lose the ability to search and discover the
					accessibility properties.</p>

			<section id="techniques">
				<h3>Techniques</h3>

				<p>The EPUB Accessibility was published together with a set of <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/techniques/">advisory techniques</a> that explain how to
					meet its requirements. The techniques do not delve into issues already covered by WCAG, but are
					primarily limited to explaining how to understand WCAG's requirements where they might be confusing
					when applied to EPUB publications.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>What tools are available to check conformance?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The DAISY Consortium maintains two tools to help check conformance of EPUB publications:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>
								<a href="https://daisy.github.io/ace/">Ace</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The Ace tool provides automated checking and reporting on a number of WCAG
									requirements. Passing the Ace validation tool is not sufficient to claim conformance
									to the specification, however, as not all WCAG requirements can be checked by
									machine.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="https://smart.daisy.org">SMART</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>The SMART tool is a complement to the Ace tool that helps evaluators walk through all of
								the manual checks needed to ensure conformance to the accessibility specification.</dd>
