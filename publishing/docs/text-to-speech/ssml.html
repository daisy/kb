				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>SSML &#8212; the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup
						Language</a> &#8212; provides a way for content creators to enhance the default synthetic speech
					rendering of their publications at the markup level. The liberal use of SSML ensures that anyone
					listening to your work via TTS playback hears the prose as intended, not based on the best guess of
					their rendering engine.</p>

				<p>The <code>phoneme</code> element from SSML has been implemented in EPUB 3 as a pair of attributes for
					defining pronunciations at the markup level:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <code>ssml:alphabet</code> attribute is used to set the default phonetic alphabet.</li>
					<li>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute is used to define the pronunciation for any element with text
						content or for which a phonetic pronunciation can be associated (e.g., an empty element whose
						voicing is derived from an attached attribute).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>(Support for the full SSML specification is not available in EPUB 3.)</p>

				<p>Unlike <a href="pls.html">PLS lexicons</a>, SSML provides fine-grained control over pronunciation at
					the markup level. SSML can be used to override a default pronunciation for heteronyms, to correctly
					pronounce complex word and number forms, etc.</p>

				<p>To use the SSML attributes, you must first declare the SSML namespace. The declaration is typically
					made once per document on the root <code>html</code> element. (See <a href="#ex01">Example
					1</a>.)</p>

				<p>A default alphabet is also typically defined once on the root <code>html</code> element, as it is
					rare to need to switch phonetic alphabets within any single document. Adding the
						<code>ssml:alphabet</code> attribute to the root ensures that all instance of the
						<code>ssml:ph</code> attribute have an in-scope alphabet defined. It is an error to define a
					pronunciation in an <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute without an in-scope alphabet, and will result in
					rendering errors. (See <a href="#ex01">Example 1</a>.)</p>

				<p>When an <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute is encountered, it's value is passed to the text-to-speech
					(TTS) engine in place of the element's content, providing the lowest-level override. The
					pronunciation of SSML attributes also takes precedence over PLS lexicon entries, ensuring that
					heteronyms and other exceptions to the rule can be properly handled.</p>

				<p>Note that the value of the <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute entirely replaces the content of the
					element that it is attached to, including all descendant elements. The attribute should not be
					attached to a <code>p</code> tag to define the pronunciation of one word contained in the paragraph,
					for example, as only that one word will be read in place of the entire paragraph. The use of
						<code>span</code> elements is recommended when no markup exists on the word(s) that need a
					pronunciation attached.</p>

				<p>The SSML attributes are not valid on SVG or MathML content, but are valid on any XHTML content that
					can be embedded in those grammars.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Should I use IPA or X-SAMPA or something else to write my pronunciations?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although IPA is arguably the most widely recognized phonetic alphabet, that does not mean
							that it has full support even in existing synthetic speech engines. Some engines support
							only their own alphabets, for example. IPA is also less developer-friendly than X-SAMPA
							because it uses Unicode characters that require modifying most keyboard layouts to input,
							whereas X-SAMPA is ASCII-based. Internal workflows should be a determining factor at this
							time. The ultimate answer will depend on what engines are employed in reading systems.</p>
						
						<p>Note that it is possible to translate one alphabet representation to the other, so work in
							either alphabet shouldn't ever be <q>lost</q> if there does turn out to be a clear winner
							and loser.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Should I use PLS lexicons or SSML?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The inclusion of the technologies in EPUB 3 was not to require a choice to be made; the
							technologies are meant to complement each other. PLS lexicons allow you to define a word
							once and have the TTS engine do the work of replacing it each time it occurs in the prose.
								<a href="ssml.html">SSML</a>, on the other hand, provides the fine-grained control that
							is just not possible in a lexicon, at the price of having to tag each instance of a term
							that has to be replaced.</p>
						
						<p>It is possible to use SSML exclusively, but it is costly in terms of production time and can
							excessively bloat the size of your content files depending on how many unique terms have to
							be handled and how often they occur.</p>
