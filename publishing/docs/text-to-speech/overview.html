				<p>The ability to synthetically voice a publication is an important accessibility feature that many
					users rely on, regardless of whether human narration is also provided (e.g., many users prefer the
					faster playback that TTS engines make possible).</p>

				<p>While basic playback is possible so long as a reading system includes TTS technology, or access to a
					similarly-enabled assistive technology, any complexity in the vocabulary used typically leads to
					mispronunciations by synthetic speech engines without enhancement.</p>

				<p>There are three technologies that enable content authors to enhance the quality of TTS playback:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt id="def-pls">
						<a href="pls.html">PLS lexicons</a>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Pronunciation Lexicon Specification defines an XML format for defining
							globally-applicable pronunciations. When words are encountered in the prose that match the
							defined entries, the provided pronunciation is used in place of the engine's default
							rendering. Lexicons provide a simple way to define pronunciations for words whose meanings
							do not change based on context.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="def-ssml">
						<a href="ssml.html">SSML markup</a>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Synthetic Speech Markup Language (SSML) allows pronunciations to be embedded directly in
							the markup. When SSML attributes are encountered on elements, the provided pronunciation is
							used in place of either the engine's default rendering or a PLS entry. SSML can be used to
							define all pronunciations, but is better used as a compliment to PLS lexicons (e.g., to
							disambiguate heteronyms and ambiguous number forms).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="def-speech">
						<a href="speech.html">CSS3 Speech properties</a>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The CSS3 Speech modules includes a grab-bag of properties that can be used to control
							playback. From providing control over the spelling out of words and numbers to inserting
							aural cues and pauses, these properties allow control of playback beyond the traditional
							enhancement of pronunciation.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>Note, however, that none of these technologies is supported in reading systems. The W3C Web
					Accessibility Initiative (WAI) currently has a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/pronunciation/"
						>Pronunciation task force</a> looking into the issues of supporting improved speech support.
					These pages will be updated if new direction comes out of that work.</p>
