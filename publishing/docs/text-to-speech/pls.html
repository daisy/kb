				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>PLS lexicons provide control over the text-to-speech (TTS) playback rendering on conforming reading
					systems. A lexicon file is like a dictionary or look-up guide, allowing the pronunciations defined
					in it to be used in place of the default rendering when matching words are encountered. Defining
					words in a lexicon ensures that users hear your work played back as expected, not based on the
					heuristics applied by the TTS engine on their reading system.</p>

				<p>Each PLS lexicon is an XML file with a root <code>lexicon</code> element. Lexicons are comprised of
					one or more <code>lexeme</code> entries, each of which defines the word(s) to match in
						<code>grapheme</code> element(s) and the replacement pronunciation to use in a
						<code>phoneme</code> element. (See <a href="#ex-01">Example 1</a>.)</p>

				<p>The <code>alias</code> element can also be used to replace one word with another. (See <a
						href="#ex-05">Example 5</a>.)</p>

				<p>The language of the lexicon and the phonetic alphabet used must both be defined on the root
						<code>lexicon</code> element.</p>

				<p>PLS entries should be created for any complex word that is important to the publication and that a
					TTS engine is likely to mispronounce. The list includes, but is not limited to, proper names and
					nouns, technical, scientific and legal terms, and complex compound words. The default rendering for
					heteronyms can also be defined in a PLS lexicon so that only variations need to be handled by SSML
					tagging.</p>

				<p>Note that PLS lexicons are not activated simply by being included in the EPUB container. You must
					reference the applicable lexicon(s) from each content document in order for them to be applied to
					the content. The <code>hreflang</code> attribute should also always be set to the language of the
					referenced PLS file. (See <a href="#ex06">Example 6</a>.)</p>

				<p>Multiple lexicons can be attached to a content document to handle embedded foreign languages. (See <a
						href="#ex-07">Example 7</a>.)</p>

				<p>Localizations are not possible within a single PLS lexicon file, but you can attach multiple lexicons
					to voice words differently for different regions. (See the <a href="#faq4">faq question</a> below
					for more information.)</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Should I use IPA or X-SAMPA or something else to write my pronunciations?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although IPA is arguably the most widely recognized phonetic alphabet, that does not mean
							that it has full support even in existing synthetic speech engines. Some engines support
							only their own alphabets, for example. IPA is also less developer-friendly than X-SAMPA
							because it uses Unicode characters that require modifying most keyboard layouts to input,
							whereas X-SAMPA is ASCII-based. Internal workflows should be a determining factor at this
							time. The ultimate answer will depend on what engines are employed in reading systems.</p>

						<p>Note that it is possible to translate one alphabet representation to the other, so work in
							either alphabet shouldn't ever be <q>lost</q> if there does turn out to be a clear winner
							and loser.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Are lexicons case sensitive?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The need to be able to define case-sensitive pronunciations is clear, but how PLS lexicons
							are processed less so. The specification itself says nothing about case sensitivity of
							graphemes, with only a requirement for case-sensitive processing defined in an <a
								href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/#AppC">informative appendix</a>. Until
							reading systems that support PLS lexicons appear, any answer is speculative, but assume case
							sensitivity because of the critical role it plays. </p>

						<p>Note that you should also consider that certain terms will appear both in lower case and
							title case in a publication without changing the pronunciation, and add
								<code>grapheme</code> elements for both cases:</p>

						<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;lexeme>
   &lt;grapheme>acetaminophen&lt;/grapheme>
   &lt;grapheme>Acetaminophen&lt;/grapheme>
   &lt;phoneme>@"sit@'mIn@f@n&lt;/phoneme>
&lt;/lexeme></code></pre>

						<p>When case conflicts occur, use SSML in the markup to correct the pronunciation of the less
							common term. For example, both spellings <q>mobile</q> and <q>Mobile</q> may refer to human
							mobility in a document that studies age-related health issues in Mobile, Alabama. Defining
							the pronunciation of <q>Mobile</q> as <q>ˈmoʊbaɪl</q> will cause the city name to be
							mispronounced (and likewise the other way around).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Are there any dangers in mixing languages?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Yes, if the rendering engine does not support voicing the specified language, the user may
							get an error or the text may be silently skipped. Error handling in such situations cannot
							be guaranteed. Language-specific lexicons will typically not be loaded.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Can I add localizations?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Not within a single PLS file. The <code>phoneme</code> element does not allow an
								<code>xml:lang</code> to be attached to it. Multiple localized lexicons could be
							attached to a content document that only specifies the stem language code, so that the
							user's localization preference setting can be used to determine the proper lexicon to apply
							(e.g., the content document specifies it is <code>en</code> and the lexicons specify
								<code>en-US</code> and <code>en-GB</code>).</p>

						<p>Care should be taken not to exclude users by specifying localizations. If a reading system
							does not include a voice that can handle the localizations, the lexicon will not be
							loaded.</p>

						<p>A better solution is to define one lexicon for all reading systems that can handle the
							region-independent language. If the publication is written in US English, for example, it
							would be better to use the default <code>en</code> code for the standard pronunciation
							lexicon and specify a locale only for targeted regions:</p>

						<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en">
   &lt;head>
	  &#8230;
	  &lt;link
		 rel="pronunciation"
		 href="#lex/en.pls"
		 type="application/pls+xml"
		 hreflang="en" />
	  &lt;link
		 rel="pronunciation"
		 href="#lex/en-GB.pls"
		 type="application/pls+xml"
		 hreflang="en-GB" />
	  &#8230;
   &lt;/head>
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
						<p>This way any user with an English-language reading system will at least hear the correct US
							pronunciations.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Should I use PLS lexicons or SSML?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The inclusion of the technologies in EPUB 3 was not to require a choice to be made; the
							technologies are meant to complement each other. PLS lexicons allow you to define a word
							once and have the TTS engine do the work of replacing it each time it occurs in the prose.
								<a href="ssml.html">SSML</a>, on the other hand, provides the fine-grained control that
							is just not possible in a lexicon, at the price of having to tag each instance of a term
							that has to be replaced.</p>
					</dd>
