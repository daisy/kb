				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>The CSS3 Speech module provides additional text-to-speech (TTS) enhancement functionality. Unlike <a
						href="pls.html">PLS lexicons</a> and <a href="ssml.html">SSML markup</a>, the Speech module
					properties are not focused on defining the correct pronunciation of words.</p>

				<p>The primary property the CSS3 Speech module adds for enhancing TTS playback is <code>speak-as</code>.
					This property provides the ability to control whether the TTS engine will read each character
					(setting to <code class="value">spell-out</code>) or number (<code>digit</code>) in a string out.
					(See <a href="#ex-01">Example 1</a> and <a href="#ex-02">Example 2</a>.) TTS engines often use
					unreliable tests based on the apparent wordiness of acronyms to determine whether to voice them, but
					this property allows you to override that behavior.</p>

				<p>The <code>speak-as</code> property also takes the complimentary values
						<code>literal-punctuation</code> and <code>no-punctuation</code>. The values, as expected,
					control whether the TTS engine will voice punctuation.</p>

				<p>The module also includes the <code>speak</code> property, which provides the ability to control TTS
					rendering of content, regardless of whether the containing element is visible or not. Setting the
						<code>none</code> value disables rendering on an element, and setting the <code>normal</code>
					value enables.</p>

				<p>The following properties are focused on non-prosodic aspects of TTS playback.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<code class="property">pause</code>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The <code class="property">pause</code> property controls the amount of pause that occurs
								before and after the element that it is applied to. Pauses are typically used to
								identify transitions between major structures, such as between paragraphs and when new
								sections are beginning. TTS engines use punctuation to provide pauses within the flow of
								the narrative.</p>

							<p>The value of the <code class="property">pause</code> property is a time value indicating
								the pause length. If only a single value is specified:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">pause: 50ms</code></pre>

							<p>that time is applied both before and after the associated element.</p>

							<p>You can individually control the time to pause before and after by including a second
								time value:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">pause: 50ms 0ms</code></pre>

							<p>The amount of pause specified occurs before any aural <code class="property">cue</code>
								and <code class="property">rest</code> at the start of the associated element, and after
								any <code class="property">rest</code> and <code class="property">cue</code> at the end
								of the element.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>
							<code class="property">cue</code>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The <code class="property">cue</code> property provides the ability to uniquely identify
								elements with an aural sound. Cues are helpful in distinguishing new headings, for
								example, as pauses alone are not a good indicator.</p>

							<p>Note that the cue property will render the associated audio clip both before and after
								the heading if only a single value is specified:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">cue: url('audio/ping.mp3');</code></pre>

							<p>Users typically only expect a cue to signal the start, so use the <code class="value"
									>null</code> value to disable cues after the associated element has been
								rendered:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">cue: url('audio/ping.mp3') null;</code></pre>

							<p>The aural cue occurs between any <code class="property">pause</code> and <code
									class="property">rest</code> at the start of the associated element, and between any
									<code class="property">rest</code> and <code class="property">cue</code> at the end
								of the element.</p>
						</dd>
							
						<dt>
							<code class="property">rest</code>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The <code class="property">rest</code> property controls the pause that occurs between
								the any aural cues and the rendering of the associated element, both before and
								after.</p>

							<p>The value of the <code class="property">rest</code> property is a time value indicating
								the pause length. If only a single value is specified:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">rest: 25ms</code></pre>

							<p>that time is applied both before and after the associated element.</p>

							<p>You can individually control the time to pause before and after by including a second
								time value:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">rest: 25ms 0ms</code></pre>

							<p>The amount of rest specified occurs after any <code class="property">pause</code> and
									<code class="property">cue</code> at the start of the associated element, and before
								any <code class="property">cue</code> and <code class="property">pause</code> at the end
								of the element.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>
							<code class="property">voice-family</code>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The <code class="property">voice-family</code> property provides control over the gender
								and type of voice used for TTS playback, allowing content producers to create more
								realistic TTS playback (e.g., alternating gender to match the character).</p>

							<p>Although it's possible to name the voice to use:</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">voice-family: 'Dave';</code></pre>

							<p>in practice, with the wide variety of devices an EPUB may be played on, such specificity
								is only so useful as it requires knowing the names of all voices available on all
								devices.</p>

							<p>Instead, it is better to request a voice using the pattern: age?, gender, integer? (where
								the question mark indicates the field is optional):</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-css">.king-lear {
   voice-family: old male 1;
}</code></pre>

							<p>The age value may be <code class="value">child</code>, <code class="value">young</code>
								or <code class="value">old</code>; the gender <code class="value">male</code>, <code
									class="value">female</code> or <code class="value">neutral</code>; and, when
								specified, the integer indicates the ordinal position of the voice to use (i.e., when
								more than one matching voice is available).</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Do I need to use the <code>-epub-</code> prefix on the properties?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No. As the properties were first introduced before the specification was stable, they were
							required to use a prefix. The unprefixed versions are now valid to use.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Can I force the TTS engine to say acronyms instead of spell them?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Speech module does not provide a way to tell an engine it must voice a capitalized term.
							When including an acronym like EPUB, you would have to use a lexicon or attach an SSML
							pronunciation attribute to absolutely ensure that it does not get spelled out.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Why do I need to control the voicing of punctuation?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although most engines will voice significant pause points, such as colons, they will
							typically not render each punctuation point in a document as it would ruin the reading
							experience. There are times when it is critical to ensure that the user is able to hear all
							the punctuation in a sentence or phrase, such as in grammar textbooks, programming guides
							and the like. (See <a href="#ex03">Example 3</a>.)</p>
						<p>Accessible technologies also enable the pronunciation of all punctuation by default in
							elements such as <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code>. Although the benefit of reading all
							punctuation in computer code should be obvious, it is not always the case that preformatted
							text needs to such detailed rendering. Applying <code class="value">no-punctuation</code> to
							a <code>pre</code> block of text ensures that it will be read without punctuation being
							announced.</p>
