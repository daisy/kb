				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>The <code>main</code> element is used to identify the primary content of a web page. It was
					introduced in HTML5 and provides a solution to the older practice of placing "skip to content"
					links at the top of pages so that users of assistive technologies could bypass any periphery
					repeated content (e.g., site headers, navigation, ads).</p>
				
				<p>The <code>main</code> element is treated by assistive technologies as a
					<a href="landmarks.html">landmark</a>, so users are able to jump directly to the element when
					it is present. It is equivalent to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#main">ARIA
						<code>main</code> role</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The need for bypass links in digital publications is not nearly as common as it is on the web
					generally, however. As publications are not wrapped inside of web page site trappings, there are
					not many publications that can benefit from identifying the start of the primary content. <a
						href="../fxl/overview.html">Fixed layout publications</a> might include repeated page headers,
					might be one example, but even those are rare.</p>
				
				<p>Care should be taken not to use the <code>main</code> element to bypass important content just
					because it precedes the primary narrative. In a textbook, for example, the chapter header,
					mini table of contents, learning objects and similar content may occur before the text of the
					chapter, but none of these are repeated content. They are unique to each chapter. Placing them
					before the <code>main</code> element may cause users to miss them.</p>
				
				<p>Note that the HTML <code>body</code> element can only have one <code>main</code> element without
					a <code>hidden</code> attribute specified on it. It is also not possible for sectioning content
					such as <code>article</code> or <code>aside</code> to have their own <code>main</code> content
					sections.</p>
				
				<p>It is not necessary to provide a label for the <code>main</code> element when there is only one
					instance, but one can be provided using either the <code>aria-label</code> or
					<code>aria-labelledby</code> attributes when there are multiple.</p>
