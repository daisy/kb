				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Providing meaningful titles for all the documents in a publication allows users to quickly identify
					where they are, and in which work. Include as specific information as possible about the content (e.g.,
					the primary heading of the section the document contains). Do not use the title of the work as the title
					for every document.</p>
					
				<p>Assistive technologies typically announce the title of each document when it is first loaded in a user agent,
					and use the titles to inform users of the nature of any tabs they have open. Depending on the type of
					user agent used, this behavior is the same.</p>
				
				<p>In the absence of a title, an assistive technology will typically announce the file name of the document,
					which in most cases is not meaningful.</p>
