				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>A limitation of the core HTML markup grammar is that it is not well-suited for differentiating common
					publishing structures. There may be hundreds of <code>aside</code> elements in a publication, for
					example, but reliably identifying which ones represent notes from sidebars from warnings and alerts
					has not been possible.</p>

				<p>For sighted users, the deficiency this causes has been masked by the enhanced visual rendering that
					CSS style sheets afford (backgrounds, borders and shading are used to convey roles visually). For
					users of assistive technologies &#8212; which rely on an understanding of the underlying markup in
					order to facilitate navigation &#8212; Web-based technologies have only had limited accessibility
					because primary and secondary material was often indistinguishable below the visual surface.</p>

				<p>To make publications more accessible, you need to consider that many users will be interacting with
					the content in non-visual ways, and for that reason the <a href="order.html">logical reading
						order</a> must be defined at the markup level. To facilitate this discovery, the ARIA
						<code>role</code> attribute allows more precise meanings to be applied to the generic tags.</p>

				<p>The ARIA specification defines many roles, but the majority are intended to aid in making scripted
					HTML interfaces more accessible (see <a href="../script/aria.html">ARIA in the scripting section</a>
					The core specification does contain a number of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#document_structure_roles">document structure roles</a> and
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles">landmark roles</a>, but these are
					focused primarily on the layout of web pages. It is more common in publishing to use the roles
					defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA
					modules</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 3</h4>

					<p>The <a href="epub-type.html"><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a> was intended to serve a similar
						function to the ARIA <code>role</code> attribute in EPUB 3, but accessibility support never
						materialized. The attribute is useful for enabling certain user agent behaviors, such as pop-up
						footnotes, but should not be used with expectations of enhancing the accessibility of
						publications.</p>

					<p>Refer to the <a href="https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA
							Role Authoring Guide</a> for a list of bad practices to avoid when switching from the
							<code>epub:type</code> to the ARIA <code>role</code> attribute.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 2</h4>

					<p>As XHTML 1.0 was released before ARIA 1.0, EPUB 2 does not support the use of ARIA attributes.
						Inclusion of the attributes will result in validation errors.</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Should I add a landmark role to every section?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No, landmarks are designed to allow the reader to quickly move to the primary sections of a
							publication, not stand in as an alternative to the table of contents.</p>

						<p>If the <a href="dpub-aria/">DPUB-ARIA vocabulary</a> does not include a role for a
							section, consider the impact on navigation before defining a new landmark with a <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#region"><code>region</code> role</a>. Landmarks
							are a flat list list of destinations so overloading the list with subsections will only
							cause confusion.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="faq-002">Does adding <code>aria-label</code> or <code>title</code> to an untitled section create a
						landmark?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Yes, so care needs to be taken not to overload the landmarks list in this way. When a
								<code>section</code> element has a label, it is handled as though the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#region"><code>region</code> role</a> has been
							applied to it, which makes the section a landmark.</p>
						<p>If an untitled section does not map to an existing landmark role, such as
								<code>doc-chapter</code>, consider the impact on navigation before labelling it.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="faq-003">Do I have to label every role?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No, whether a label is required depends on whether the role requires an accessible name. To
							determine if an accessible name is required, see the role's definition in the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/">DPUB-ARIA</a> or <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions">ARIA</a> specification. If the
							role does not have an "Accessible name required" field in its list of properties, check the
							role's superclass (the value is inherited).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="faq-004">Should I always label landmarks?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Best practice is to provide a label for landmarks using the <code>aria-labelledby</code>
							(when a heading is present in the text) or <code>aria-label</code> attributes (when a
							section does not have an explicit heading).</p>
						<p>Although labels are not required for DPUB-ARIA landmarks, support for the vocabulary is also
							not yet widespread. Adding a label ensures that default processing rules for HTML will
							create a landmark even if the vocabulary is not recognized (i.e., adding a label to a
								<code>section</code> element indicates to browsers to treat the section as an implied <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#region"><code>region</code></a> when creating the
							accessibility tree).</p>
