				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Why can't I use a paragraph/div for each list item?</dt>
					<dd><p>If you use paragraphs or divs, a user using an assistive technology to navigate the document
						will have to traverse every item one at a time in order to continue reading. The proper use of
						lists allows these users to easily skip past the entire list, and move through and jump out of
						the list at any time.</p>
						<p>Also, when using paragraphs, any hierarchical relationship is typically lost, as indenting is
							emulated using CSS.</p>
						<p>And finally, creating proper lists allows the user agent to announce the total number of items
							in the list and the user's current position as they navigate through, making it simpler for
							them to reference the location again should they need.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Why can't I use <code>br</code> tags to create lists?</dt>
					<dd><p>Print-first tools often generate lists like this (usually from bad formatting), where single
						paragraphs contain the entire list and each item is delineated by a hard line break (the
						<code>br</code> tag). Although this might seem to solve the problem of being able to quickly
						skip past or escape out of the list, it makes navigating the list quickly by item impossible. The
						user now has to listen to every <q>item</q> in turn.</p>
						<p>Using <code>br</code> tags also makes it difficult to return to a specific item, as there is no
							way to navigate back to the text at a later time but to listen to the content again in full.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>I want to use a custom image for a bullet, can I ignore this rule?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, for all the reasons above plus CSS has always allowed custom images to be defined for list
						items without having to resort to the <code>img</code> element. See the CSS
						<code>list-style-image</code> property.</p></dd>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Lists are often overlooked as an accessibility feature, but the ability to move quickly and effectively
					through long lists of data points is a key reading need. Unfortunately, it's still the case that lists
					are rendered as anything but proper HTML (e.g., using a new paragraph for each item, using manual line
					breaks to separate entries, etc.).</p>
				
				<p>Sighted users rarely notice the advantage of being able to quickly skim a list, determine if it's of any
					interest and/or selectively read items. When a user has to traverse every item in the list one item at
					a time to get to the end, or listen to the entire list from beginning to end, the problems of bad markup
					become more pronounced (see <a href="#faq">the faq section</a> for a deeper explanation of the
					problems). Properly tagging lists is a small measure that can greatly decrease user frustration.</p>
				
				<p>In order to facilitate navigation of lists, always tag the items in the set using the appropriate ordered
					(<code>ol</code>) or unordered (<code>ul</code>) list element. Do not use <code>br</code> tags to
					visually render items on separate lines, or use similar styling tricks to make the visual appearance of a
					list, as it will impede navigation.</p>
				
				<p>Using the correct list type is also important as it may be the only cue to the user whether the order of
					items is significant. An alphabetical list is not necessarily an ordered list, for example; arranging
					items is not the same as assigning them a specific order. If you can re-arrange the items without
					changing the meaning of the list, you've defined an unordered list (e.g., indexes and bibliographies do
					not lose meaning when re-ordered).</p>
				
				<p>The definition list (<code>dl</code>) element is for name/value lists. These can include dictionaries,
					glossaries, frequently asked questions and similar. The element should not be used for character
					dialogue, as noted in the HTML5 specification. Repeating character names in <code>dt</code> elements
					purely to indicate who is speaking breaks this semantic. Although the automatic formatting that comes
					with the list type may fit certain formats, like plays, each <code>dt</code> element is meant to define a
					unique value.</p>
				
				<p>List elements must not be used for purely presentational purposes (e.g., using <code>dl</code> lists to
					make bolded headings with indented paragraphs).</p>
