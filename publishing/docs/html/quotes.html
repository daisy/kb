				<h3>Techniques</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Identify quotes separated from the primary narrative using the <code>blockquote</code> element. [[WCAG-1.3.1]]</li>
					<li>Identify quotes inline with the primary narrative using the <code>q</code> element. [[WCAG-1.3.1]]</li>
					<li>Identify the source of quotes using the <code>cite</code> element. [[WCAG-1.3.1]]</li>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Can I put the citation in the <code>blockquote</code> tag?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The HTML specification makes this illegal:</p>
						<blockquote>Attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the <code>blockquote</code>
							element.</blockquote>
						<p>The citation is separate from the quote itself. You can use a <code>figure</code> tag to
							associate a <code>blockquote</code>, as in <a href="#ex-03">example 3</a> with its citation
							but this is not strictly necessary.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-002">Do I have to use a <code>figure</code> tag when there is a citation?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No. The choice whether to use the extra <code>figure</code> tag markup is at author discretion.
							It may be useful to group quotes and citations for internal workflow purposes, for example.
							The choice to use a <code>figure</code> does not significantly change the experience for
							assistive technology users.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-003">Why do some sites say <code>blockquote</code> can have a <code>footer</code> for the
						citation?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Technically, it is valid for a <code>blockquote</code> to contain a <code>footer</code>, but
							the meaning of a <code>footer</code> element in a <code>blockquote</code> is unclear.
							According to the HTML specification, a <code>footer</code> applies to its nearest sectioning
							or <code>body</code> element, so a <code>footer</code> in a <code>blockquote</code> does not
							describe that element.</p>
						<p>More specifically to this question, though, there were two different maintainers of HTML for a
							while. One group made the practice of using a <code>footer</code> for the citation legal while
							the other did not. The version of HTML that made it legal is now defunct.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-004">Can I cite a speaker or author name?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The HTML specification also says this illegal:</p>
						<blockquote>The cite element represents the title of a work &#8230; A person's name is not 
							the title of a work &#8230; and the element must therefore not be used to mark up 
							people's names.</blockquote>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-005">Does the <code>cite</code> attribute do anything?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Not for end users at this time, no. Reading systems will not make the URL in the attribute
							available to follow.</p>
						<p>If you need the attribute other reasons (e.g., internal referencing of where a quote came from),
							or have a script to process the value, you can include it on both the <code>blockquote</code>
							and <code>q</code> tags.</p>
					</dd>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>HTML includes two tags for identifying quotes:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt><code>blockquote</code></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>blockquote</code> element is for quotes that are offset from the main text. When
							rendered visually, the quote is distinguished by a larger indented on the left than the 
							surrounding paragraphs. Quote characters are not added to the content inside the element.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt><code>q</code></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>q</code> element is for identifying quotes that are incorporated within another
							paragraph of text. When rendered visually, quote characters are automatically added, where
							the characters used change based on the language of the text and whether the quote is nested
							in another quote.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>When <code>blockquote</code> and <code>q</code> tags are used to identify text quoted from another
					source, users of assistive technologies have access to this important information. When the correct
					semantic elements are not used, users may not always be aware that a quote is being read. Works of
					fiction, for example, sometimes intersperse fictional quotes without clearly indicating in the text
					that what follows is a quote.</p>
				
				<p>Quote tags, specifically the inline <code>q</code> tags, are not used to tag regular character 
					dialog in works of fiction. They are intended for quoting text from other sources, both real
					and fictional.</p>
				
				<p>The primary point of confusion with quoting other sources is not in tagging the quoted text, but
					in how to represent the citation. Some authors want to include the citation within the blockquote,
					but according to the HTML specification this is invalid. Some authors also want to cite the author
					of a quote instead of the work it comes from, especially if there is no specific source (e.g., the
					phrase is a saying generally attributed to the person). This is also stated to be invalid by the
					HTML specification.</p>
				
				<p>The problem with the HTML specification rules is that they are unenforceable by validators. Unless
					you manually spot a violation, a publication that does not follow these practices will not be
					flagged. Whether these violations have any impact on users of assistive technologies is also
					debatable, and for a while the W3C HTML5 specification (now defunct) allowed more flexibility
					in their application.</p>
				
				<p>Regardless, it is always best to follow accepted markup practices. Although the rules have little
					impact today, the separation of quotes from citations, and works from authors, could have benefits
					in the future.</p>
