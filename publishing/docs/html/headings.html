				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Can I use an <code>h1</code> heading for every section?</dt>
					<dd><p>The HTML outline algorithm has now been removed from the HTML specification &#8212; user
						agents and assistive technologies never supported this feature. If you use an <code>h1</code>
						heading for every section, they will all appear as top-level headings to assistive
						technologies, impeding users' ability to navigate the content.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-002">Should heading levels be sequential?</dt>
					<dd><p>Headings should reflect the hierarchy of the publication, so an <code>h2</code> should always be
							used for secondary level headings, <code>h3</code> for tertiary, and so on. Avoid gaps in numbering
							whenever possible (e.g., using <code>h3</code> for headings below an <code>h1</code>).</p>
						<p>Using consistent numbering ensures that users are not confused by the structure of a publication.
							Assistive technologies provide shortcut keys that allow users to move through the content
							effectively by heading number, for example. If there are gaps in the numbering, users may not 
							realize there are subsections depending on how they try to navigate (i.e., trying to navigate to a
							specific heading level will not work; only the generic move to next heading option will).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-003">Wasn't <code>hgroup</code> not recommended for a long time?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Yes, the element was originally part of the HTML outline algorithm, a feature that was never
							implemented by browsers or assistive technologies. It allowed multiple heading elements to
							be grouped, but only one heading was supposed to apply to the document. Following this
							model would cause assistive technologies to announce all the headings in the tag,
							however.</p>
						
						<p>The removal of the outline algorithm from HTML along with a change to the element's content
							model now makes it invalid to include more than one heading element, so it cannot cause the
							problem with assistive technologies anymore.</p>
						
						<p>It was previously recommended to wrap the heading and any subtitles in a <code>header</code>
							element, but document headers can contain more than just the title and subtitles. Using
							<code>hgroup</code> provides a more meaningful way to group these headings. You can include
							an <code>hgroup</code> inside a <code>header</code> to combine a heading group with other
							header content.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-004">Should I use <code>doc-subtitle</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>It is better to avoid using this role. It was meant to address the heading navigation problems
							that using a numbered heading for subtitles causes in assistive technologies, but it is often
							treated as a heading by assistive technologies (i.e., it causes the very problem it was meant
							to solve).</p>
						<p>Now that the <code>hgroup</code> element can tie headings and subtitles together without
							using multiple heading elements, it is better to use it instead.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Headings are one of the primary means of navigation for users of assistive technologies.</p>
				
				<p>Each <code>section</code> should have a numbered heading (e.g., <code>h1</code>) that reflects its level
					in the document hierarchy, as numbered headings allow assistive technologies to navigate the document structure.</p>
				
				<p>Each heading element must represent a single heading. Do not break a heading up into separate tags for
					visual formatting. If you need to include subheadings, incorporate them into the main heading or include
					them in a subsequent paragraph, using a <code>header</code> tag to encapsulate the full heading.</p>
				
				<p>If a section of text does not have a heading, include a heading in an <code>aria-label</code> attribute on
					the enclosing element. Assistive technologies will announce this label and alert users that a new section
					is starting.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="note-1">
					<p id="note-1" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Do not use heading elements within <code>figure</code>, <code>blockquote</code> and other HTML5
						sectioning root elements. Although these features may have titles, using heading elements will force
						users to navigate through them to find the next section.</p>
				</div>
				
				<section id="hgroup">
					<h4>Heading groups</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>hgroup</code> element solves the need for multi-level headings that act as a single unit.</p>
					
					<p>The element takes a single numbered heading tag (<code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code>) for the section
						heading, but also allows multiple <code>p</code> tags to be included in the group to define any
						subtitles (refer to <a href="#ex-02">example 2</a>). This pattern avoids the problem of using
						numbered heading for the subtitle, which can confuse readers into thinking a new section is
						starting.</p>
					
					<p>It also avoids the problem of using a <code>header</code> element to group the heading with its
						subtitle, as the <code>header</code> element can contain more than just the title and subtitles
						(e.g., headers might also include epigraphs, images, etc.). A heading group can be added to a
						<code>header</code> element when there is additional content:</p>

   &lt;header>

      &lt;hgroup>
         &lt;h2 id="c01-hd">Chapter 1&lt;h2>
         &lt;p>Let there be light&lt;/p>
      &lt;hgroup>
      &lt;p role="doc-epigraph">Now the earth was formless and void, 
         and darkness was over the surface of the deep.&lt;/p>
   &lt;/header>
