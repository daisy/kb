				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

					<dt id="faq-001">Can I use pictures of tables?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although table rendering is still problematic in ebooks, including images of tables instead of the
							actual data takes the content away from anyone who cannot see it.</p>
						<p>Tables are a problem that still need solving in user agents, as most user agents aren't
							able to provide extended horizontal or vertical scrolling to facilitate rendering. As a result,
							large tables get rendered in the available space &#8211; leaving rows and columns to spill across
							page views &#8211; compromising the quality of the ebook for sighted users.</p>
						<p>If you are going to include an image of a table, consider providing a link to a file containing
							the table markup. Users with text-to-speech playback available will be able to navigate the 
							markup regardless of the rendering quality.</p>
						<p>Some user agents render pop-out content in browser windows, which can also improve reading for
							sighted users unable to read images that render too small or blow out of the viewport.</p>
						<p>See also this <a href="http://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/">CSS-Tricks article on
							responsive tables</a> for an alternate approach to visual table rendering based on the

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>When tables are not structured accessibly, the data they contain can quickly become a meaningless sea of
					numbers, facts and figures to someone moving through them a cell at a time. Users who cannot see the
					table cannot use visual cheats like checking the alignment and scanning back to the top headers to
					orient themselves as they go. Equivalent information needs to be encoded into the table to facilitate
					comprehension.</p>
				
				<p>Using HTML table elements to markup up tabular data ensures that users of assistive technologies
					are able to move by row and column through the data. It also provides them the context they need
					to understand the data they encounter.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="scope-layout">
					<p id="scope-layout" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Using tables for layout purposes is no longer valid per the HTML specification. Refer to the <a
						href="tables-layout.html">Layout Tables</a> page for further discussion.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>The following subsections describe the basic practices essential to making any table accessible.
					More complex issues are described separately in the knowledge base (refer to the related topics 
					menu).</p>
				
				<section id="headers">
					<h4>Headers</h4>
					
					<p>One of the primary aids for table navigation is the proper use of headers. Correctly identified and
						linked headers provide helpful context as users navigate the data points.</p>
					
					<p>A column or row header is identified using the <code>th</code> element. Data cells are identified
						using the <code>td</code> element.</p>
					
					<p>A common bad practice is to style <code>td</code> elements to look like headers (e.g., by bolding
						the text and adding background shading). Unless a <code>th</code> element is used, assistive
						technologies will not recognize the cell as a header and will not be able to announce the
						header to users as they navigate through the data.</p>
					
					<p>The simplest kinds of tables contain a single header for each column or row (see examples 1 and 2).
						When the data in such tables is self-describing and/or the table is not very large, it is not 
						necessary to identify the headers any further. Users will be able to understand the data.</p>
					
					<p>As soon as there is any complexity, such as multiple headings or many rows of data, it is necessary
						to identify the "scope" of the headings. Adding a <code>scope</code> attribute tells assistive
						technologies whether the header applies to the current column or row. The attribute can also be used
						to apply headers to multiple columns or rows.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="scope-note">
						<p id="scope-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>For more information about the <code>scope</code> attribute, refer to the <a
							href="tables-scope.html">Headers Scope</a> page.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>In some cases, tables will have complex headers for which a simple scope declaration is not
						sufficient. For example, when a header for cells is not in the same column or row. In these
						cases, the <code>headers</code> attribute allows the individual cells that comprise the header
						to be identified. The attribute contains a list of one or more references to the IDs of the
						header cells that apply.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="headers-note">
						<p id="headers-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>For more information about the <code>headers</code> attribute, refer to the <a
							href="tables-headers.html">Complex Headers</a> page.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="struct">
					<h4>Table Structures</h4>
					
					<p>Tables can be structured to better represent the purpose of sets of rows using the 
						<code>thead</code> (table header), <code>tbody</code> (table body), and <code>tfoot</code>
						(table footer) elements.</p>
					
					<p>A table can only have one <code>thead</code> element, and it must be the first row-containing
						element of the table. Although adding a <code>thead</code> element to group the header rows 
						is a good semantic markup practice, the element does not affect the accessibility of tables.
						It is primarily included for usability reasons. For example, the rows in a <code>thead</code>
						are often scripted to remain static while a table is scrolled. The <code>thead</code> is also
						used by browsers to repeat the headings when printing a table (i.e., when a table is split
						across print pages).</p>
					
					<p>After the header can come one or more <code>tbody</code> elements. Each <code>tbody</code>
						represents one section of a table. Using multiple <code>tbody</code> elements allows each
						section to have unique headers, for example. This practice can improve the readability of
						these kinds of tables, so is beneficial to the accessiblity.</p>
					
					<p>Finally, a table can have a single <code>tfoot</code> element at the end. The <code>tfoot</code>
						element is where column summaries are expressed. Using a <code>tfoot</code> allows users to
						find this information without having to navigate through every row. It is not the location for
						placing extraneous content like footnotes (see <a href="#ex-04">example 4</a>).</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="abbr">
					<h4>Abbreviations</h4>
					
					<p>When a table header is more than a few words long, having it repeated for every data cell can
						slow down users. To avoid these lengthy repetitions, it is possible to assign an shorter
						header using the <code>abbr</code> attribute.</p>
					
					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;th &#8230; abbr="Total insurance">
   Total insurance coverage
   cost on per annum basis
&lt;/th>
&lt;th &#8230; abbr="Total interest">
   Total interest payments
   for the covered period
&lt;/th></code></pre>
					
					<p>The abbreviated title will be used in place of the full header when announcing the cells beneath
						it.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="abbr-note">
						<p id="abbr-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>Support for the <code>abbr</code> attribute is inconsistent. <a 
							href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/3566">NVDA does not support</a> the
							attribute, but other assistive technologies like Jaws and Voiceover do.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="cap-sum">
					<h4>Captions and Summaries</h4>
					
					<p>In order to help users understand the purpose of tables and the ordering of their content,
						it is necessary to add captions and summaries.</p>
					
					<p>A caption is the equivalent of a title for a table. It can be provided in the dedicated
						<code>caption</code> element that tables can contain, or it can be expressed through other
						means, such as a figure caption. More information about captions and how to mark them up
						is provided in the <a href="tables-captions.html">Table Captions</a> page.
					
					<p>A summary provides a description of the structure of a table. It helps users who cannot see the
						content or have difficulty tracking information across rows or down columns understand the layout
						of the data. More information about including summaries is provided in the <a 
							href="tables-summary.html">Table Summaries</a> page.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="styling">
					<h4>Styling</h4>
					
					<p>Although ensuring the structure of tables is critically important for users of assistive
						technologies, markup is not the only consideration in making tables accessible. How tables
						are styled also impacts their readability by users with low vision or who are color blind,
						and also for users with cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia.</p>
					
					<p>Some key considerations to take into account when styling tables include:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>As header cells are often shaded to distinguish them visually, it is important to ensure
							sufficient contrast with the foreground text.</li>
						<li>Data cells must not be given the same appearance as headers as this can confuse users about
							their purpose.</li>
						<li>Use consistent alignment of data in cells to help users follow the data (e.g., having all
							numeric data right-aligned).</li>
						<li>Consider using alternating row colors, or row highlighting, to make it easier for users with
							perception difficulties to visually track their way across.</li>
