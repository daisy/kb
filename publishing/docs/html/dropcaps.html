				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Drop caps were traditionally used to highlight new sections of a document. Latin manuscripts, for
					example, did not include breaks when a new section began, so drop caps provided a visual signal for
					users skimming the text.</p>
				
				<p>Publications are no longer formatted this way, as major new sections are now typically highlighted by
					being placed at the start of a new page with a larger face heading.</p>
				
				<p>Decorative drop caps are still sometimes found in publications, however, to give them an extra
					flourish, but the stylized letters no longer serve a functional purpose. This extra formatting
					unfortunately impedes the ability of some users to read the text. Some examples include:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Assistive technologies cannot properly read the first word when the formatting of the stylized
						drop cap separates it from the rest of the word.</li>
					<li>Zooming leads to a pixelated image of the drop cap when images are used.</li>
					<li>Following the text flow becomes problematic due to the extended size of the drop cap (e.g.,
						users with dyslexia may have trouble following from the drop cap to the first line or finding
						the correct next line to resume reading).</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>For these reasons, the best advice is to avoid using drop caps.</p>
				
				<p>In practice, however, avoiding drop caps entirely is not possible. The following sections review some
					of the most common practices for formatting drop caps accessibly.</p>
				
				<section id="first-letter">
					<h4>CSS <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-element</h4>
					
					<p>The CSS <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/selector.html#first-letter"
								><code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-element</a> is currently the best option for
						formatting drop caps in an accessible way.</p>
					
					<p>For example, given the following example markup for a new chapter:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ln-html" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;section role="doc-chapter" id="c01">
   &lt;h2>Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
   &lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit &#8230;&lt;/p>
   &#8230;
&lt;/section></code></pre>
					
					<p>The letter "L" could be styled as a drop cap using the following CSS selector to get the first
						letter of the first <code>p</code> element in each section marked as a chapter:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ln-css" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>section[@role='doc-chapter'] p:first-child::first-letter {
   float: left;
   font-size: 3em;
   line-height: 1;
   padding-right: 0.1em;
}</code></pre>
					
					<p>The following is an example of how this markup would display:</p>
					
					<p class="first">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
						incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation
						ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit
						in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
						cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
					
					<p>Because the markup of the drop cap is done using only CSS, there is no impact on the ability of
						assistive technologies to voice the first world. In addition, it may be possible for users to
						change the text formatting in their reading systems if the enlarged letter makes reading
						difficult.</p>
					
					<p>The one drawback of this approach is that it does not always result in consistent formatting of
						the drop cap. The reliance on floating the letter and adjusting the line height results in
						differences in the alignment of the drop cap across reading systems and browsers.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="initial-letter">
					<h4>CSS <code>initial-letter</code> property</h4>
					
					<p>The CSS <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-inline/#sizing-drop-initials"
								><code>initial-letter</code> property</a> has the potential to fix the formatting
						problems that result from trying to create a drop cap using the <code>first-letter</code>
						selector with floats and line heights. The value of the property defines how many lines of text
						high to make the selected text.</p>
					
					<p>For example, to create a drop cap two lines high, only the following CSS is needed:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-il-css" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>section[@role='doc-chapter'] p:first-child {
	initial-letter: 2;
}</code></pre>
					
					<p>(Note that to create a raised cap, you would use 
					<code>initial-letter: 2 1</code>)</p>
					
					<p>The problem with this approach is that there is currently <a
							href="https://caniuse.com/?search=initial-letter">limited support for the property</a> (only
						partial support in Safari as of writing). Until support becomes more widespread, the other
						alternatives should be used.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="html-img">
					<h4>Images</h4>
					
					<p>The HTML <code>img</code> tag is sometimes used to format drop caps as in the following
						example:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-hi-01" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img src="images/caps/a.jpg" alt="C"/>all me Ishmael &#8230;</code></pre>
					
					<p>The use of an <code>img</code> tag interferes with the ability of screen readers to properly
						render the text, however. In this case, a screen reader would announce "Image Cee all me
						Ishmael".</p>
					
					<p>A similar pattern is to use <code>span</code> tag to format the drop cap:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-hi-02" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;span class="dropcap">C&lt;/span>all me Ishmael &#8230;</code></pre>
					
					<p>A CSS background image is often applied to ensure the formatting of the letter. This practice is
						no better than using an <code>img</code> tag, however, as it also results in the first letter being
						pronounced separately from the rest of the world.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="aria">
					<h4>ARIA</h4>
					
					<p>Using ARIA attributes and hidden content is sometimes proposed as a workaround to the problem of
						using an <code>img</code> or <code>span</code> tag on the first letter. See the article <a
							href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/10/accessible-drop-caps.html">Accessible Drop Caps</a>,
						for example.</p>
					
					<p>The problem with this approach, is that on top of relying on support for ARIA attributes in EPUB
						Reading Systems, which is poor, it also relies on being able to hide content, which is also not
						well supported.</p>
					
					<p>As a result, although the approach seems like it could be accessible, it may result in content
						duplication both visually and for users of assistive technologies. It is better left for purely
						web-based publications.</p>
