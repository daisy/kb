				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-endnote-dep">Should I use the <code>doc-endnote</code> role?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><strong>No.</strong> Use of the <code>doc-endnote</code> role is now deprecated due to a
							technical incompatibility with the core ARIA role module. ARIA does not allow roles from a
							module to satisfy the requirements of core roles, so although <code>doc-endnote</code>
							behaves like a list item, it technically does not fulfill the requirement that lists have
							list item children. That makes it invalid in both HTML list elements and as a child of the
							ARIA <code>list</code> role.</p>
						<p>While AT uses should not experience any problems if you have already used the role, it is
							best to avoid it moving forward to avoid errors in your content.</p>
						<p>The role is also generally redundant. If a section of notes is identified using the
							<code>doc-endnotes</code> role, users and assistive technologies will understand the list
							within the section contains the endnotes.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Footnotes and endnotes have proven an impediment to the reading experience because they interrupt the
					narrative flow. When footnotes are placed immediately following the paragraph that references them,
					users had to manually navigate past them each time, as they are typically indistinguishable from text
					content. Even endnotes, grouped at the end of the section, require the user to jump past them.</p>
				
				<p>The HTML structural elements, together with the <code>role</code> attribute, provide a means of
					alleviating this problem, by clearly marking individual footnotes and endnotes, and sections of them. Not
					only does this allow accessible user agents to ignore the notes except when followed from their
					referents, but it allows any user agent to handle them more intelligently (e.g., as pop-ups).</p>
				
				<p>Notes that are grouped at the end of a section should be grouped using <code>doc-endnotes</code> role
					(see <a href="#ex-02">Example 2</a>). Lists allow users to move through them more effectively
					(e.g., each list item number will typically correspond sequentially to the contained note number,
					and users should have the ability to jump through more than one list item at a time when there are
					many notes).</p>
				
				<section id="notes-tables">
					<h4>Notes in Tables</h4>
					
					<p>If notes occur in a table, avoid placing them in a <code>tfoot</code> element, as it is intended for
						summaries of the columns. Footnotes can follow the table or can be grouped together with the table inside
						a <code>figure</code>. See the <a href="tables.html">Tables section</a> for an example.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="note-refs">
					<h4>Note References</h4>
					
					<p>Note references must be tagged using the HTML <code>a</code> element to ensure users do not
						have to visually locate the corresponding note.</p>
					
					<p>The <code>sup</code> element may be used to superscript note references, but it adds extra verbosity
						(assistive technologies will announce the text is superscripted in addition to being linked).
						The CSS <code>vertical-align</code> property can be set to superscript the <code>a</code>
						elements without the additional voicing (see <a href="#ex-03">Example 3</a>).</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="role-note-hd">
						<p id="role-note-hd" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>Until there is greater support for announcing the <code>doc-footnote</code> role, the
							<code>sup</code> element provides some context for the note references. As support for the
							role increases, however, the use of explicit superscripting will become redundant. At that
							time, preference should be given to CSS formatting.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="note-backlink">
					<h4>Back Referencing</h4>
					
					<p>Although not specifically required to be accessible, it is good practice to backlink groups of
						notes to their referent locations in the text (see <a href="#ex-04">Example 4</a>). If a user
						is surveying the notes, backlinks will allow them to quickly find the text the note refers
						to.</p>
					
					<p>Ensure that the link text for each back reference clearly identifies where the link goes. Avoid
						using the same text over and over, like "Go to reference". When users of assistive technologies
						access the list of links on the page, the context of each link is lost.</p>
