				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Why do I need to use <code>aria-details</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although similar in purpose to the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute,
							the <code>aria-details</code> attribute does not result in stringified content
							(i.e., the user will be able to navigate the description, or link to it, as 
							structured HTML).</p>
						
						<p>Also, even though a description may be near to its image, using <code>aria-details</code>
							provides a programmatic means for users of assistive technologies to rapidly access
							the description. Otherwise, the user might miss the description if, for example, the
							link to it is at the end of a figure caption they do not read through.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-002">Why not <code>longdesc</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>longdesc</code> attribute is now considered an obsolete feature of HTML.</p>
						<p>Although published as a separate extension of HTML by W3C, it is not supported in EPUB.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-004">When is a <code>figure</code> tag needed?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If an image is important to the publication, but not required to be read at the point of
							insertion (i.e., it is not part of the logical reading order), use a <code>figure</code>
							tag to enclose it. See the <a href="figures.html">Figures</a> page for more
							information.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-005">Should I use <code>img</code> or <code>picture</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>picture</code> element is only needed if you provide more than one version of the
							image (e.g., different resolutions or different formats targeted for different devices).
							The <code>picture</code> element otherwise does not have any accessibility advantages over
							the <code>img</code> element if only a single image format is available. Both allow for 
							alternative text and extended descriptions.</p>

				<h3>Writing Descriptions</h3>
				
				<section id="alt">
					<h4>Alternative Text</h4>
					
					<p>Images that are central to the understanding of a publication must always include a text
						alternative in their <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="note-1">
						<p id="note-1" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>If an image is purely decorative, the <code>alt</code> attribute should be left empty. See the
							<a href="images-deco.html">Decorative Images</a> page for more information.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>The alternative text representation of an image is not designed to be a full description of the
						image. A common mistake authors make is to use the <code>alt</code> attribute to provide a
						paragraph or longer explanation of an image. Users, however, only want a very brief description
						of an image in its alternative text, as they often have to listen to the entire text before
						they can continue reading. The alternative text should allow the user to decide if they want to
						read the extended description without bogging down their reading experience.</p>
					
					<p>One of the best ways to think about writing the alternative text for an image is to consider why
						it is there for visual readers. The goal is not completeness of detail. It is also not to add
						detail that cannot be determined from the image itself (i.e., that visual readers will not have
						access to).</p>
					
					<p>Writing short and concise alternative text is something of an art, as the information needed
						from each image is never exactly the same. A useful technique, though, is to try and answer the
						most relevant "who, what, where, when, why and how" questions about the image in as few words
						as possible.</p>
					
					<p>For example, consider this <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo#/media/File:Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG">battle
						scene</a>. Asking each question:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>What is the picture? A painting by William Sadler II. The painter is not named in the
							painting, so the alternative text should not introduce this information.</li>
						<li>Who is in the picture? The French and English armies.</li>
						<li>What are they doing? Engaging in a battle.</li>
						<li>Where is this happening? Waterloo.</li>
						<li>When is this happening? Not mentioned in the picture so should not be introduced in the
							alternative text.</li>
						<li>Why are they fighting? Too complicated to answer and not pertinent to the painting
							itself.</li>
						<li>How are they fighting? Again, too complicated for alternative text.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Combining the most relevant answers might net alternative text: "Painting of the English and
						French armies at Battle of Waterloo".</p>
					
					<p>The context of the picture also plays an important role in how to describe it, though. If this
						painting were in a book on British history, for example, the user may already know the
						participants and dates, and the painter may not be relevant. In this case, the alternative text
						could be further reduced to: "Painting of the Battle of Waterloo."</p>
					
					<p>If the painting were used in an anti-war book, on the other hand, its alternative text might
						highlight the barbarity of the battle: "Painting depicting the slaughter of troops at the
						Battle of Waterloo."</p>
					
					<p>So long as the alternative text accurately conveys the purpose of the image within the
						publication, there are many ways you can frame the text.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="extended">
					<h4>Extended Descriptions</h4>
					
					<p>Writing the extended description for an image tends to cause less confusion as these
						descriptions are not as restrictive about length as alternative text. But, like
						alternative text, the goal when authoring extended descriptions is still to explain the purpose
						of the image as succinctly as possible. It is not to describe every minute detail, but to
						convey the essential information.</p>
					
					<p>So, the first step in writing an extended description is to determine if an extended description
						is even necessary. Sometimes an image does not need a lot of description, especially if its
						context is already provided in the surrounding text. Ask yourself if the description you intend
						to write will add pertinent information that aids in the understanding, or is it detail for 
						details sake?</p>
					
					<p>For example, consider an image of two world leaders smiling and shaking hands. If the image is
						only included to show their cordial relationship, an alternative text that indicates who is in
						the picture and what they are doing is probably sufficient. Adding an extended description of
						the room they are, the clothes they are wearing, the people around them, etc. is not helpful to
						the reader.</p>
					
					<p>Once you establish that an extended description is necessary, the process of writing the
						description is like writing the alternative text. The same "who, what, where, when, why,
						and how" questions need to be looked at, only this time with the goal being to fully capture
						the essential information.</p>
					
					<p>The context of the picture will once again influence what information is essential to the
						publication. Using the <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo#/media/File:Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG">battle
						scene</a> from the alternative text section, for example, a book on military strategy might
						focus on explaining the apparent disarray of the attack. It would not be necessary to explain
						the actions of everyone in the painting, only to give a general sense of the surging
						nature of the battle.</p>
					
					<p>The extended description should not introduce facts that are not discernible from the visual
						depiction of the image. It is not the place, for example, to describe the generals, their
						battle plans, etc. This information should be in a caption for the image if not described in
						the surrounding text, as it is not apparent from the image alone.</p>
					
					<p>For additional help writing extended descriptions, the <a
						href="https://poet.diagramcenter.org/how.html">DIAGRAM Center's interactive examples</a> show
						how to approach describing various types of images.</p>

				<h3>Description Methods</h3>
				
				<p>The following sections explain some of the better supported methods for adding extended descriptions
					to images. Other methods are possible, but support in reading systems is often not as robust as in
					browsers. For testing information, refer to the DIAGRAM Center's <a 
						href="http://diagramcenter.org/best-practices-for-authoring-extended-descriptions.html">Best
						Practices for Authoring Extended Descriptions in EPUB</a>.</p>
				
				<section id="hyperlinks">
					<h4>Hyperlinks</h4>
					
					<p>Plain old hyperlinks are one of the most widely accessible ways to direct users to a
						description. Adding an <code>aria-details</code> attribute to the image enables
						assistive technologies to make the link available to the user when they encounter the
						image instead of having to search for the link after.</p>
					
					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;img src="crime-map.jpg"
     aria-details="gotham"
     alt="Crime in Gotham City">

&lt;a id="gotham" href="crime-desc.xhtml">Description&lt;/a>
</code></pre>
					
					<p>Note that a hyperlink does not always have to reference a description in another document;
						descriptions might be included at the end of a section, like footnotes.</p>
					
					<p>In EPUB, when possible, the linked description should be in a file by itself to avoid issues
						reaching the description (i.e., not all reading systems are able to locate the user properly 
						when there are multiple descriptions in the same file). If there are many images, however,
						adding each description to a separate file can bloat the spine (i.e., every description file
						must be listed).</p>
					
					<p>An image can be used to minimize the appearance of the link, but EPUB some reading systems
						have issues with image links (they cannot be activated).</p>
					
					<p>Despite these shortcomings, however, hyperlinks are one of the more reliable techniques
						currently supported in EPUB.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="details">
					<h4>The <code>details</code> element</h4>
					
					<p>The <code>details</code> element provides a collapsible means of including a description
						for an image. The advantage of this element is that it allows both sighted and non-sighted
						readers access to the description at their discretion (i.e., sighted readers can choose
						whether to expand and read the description just as assistive technologies users can decide
						whether to have the text read out).</p>
					
					<p>Support for this element is not yet universal in EPUB, however. The element text may always
						be open by default, and expanding the element when initially closed can cause problems with the
						pagination produced by user agents (e.g., opening the element pushes content at the bottom of
						the page out of view).</p>
					
					<p>To use the element in EPUB publications, it is also recommended to put the element immediately
						after a closing <code>figure</code> tag when the description is for a figure. The element often
						does not work when included inside a <code>figure</code>.</p>
					
					<p>Despite these shortcomings, this element is still one of the more reliable techniques currently
						supported in EPUB.</p>
