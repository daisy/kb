				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>Marking secondary content with the <code>aside</code> element enables assistive technologies
					to distinguish it from the primary narrative, allowing users to skip over the material.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note">
					<p id="support-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>The default nature of the <code>aside</code> element is changing. <code>asides</code>
						without an accessible name that are within a <code>section</code> element will no longer
						be considered complementary landmarks. They will instead be considered generic elements
						(i.e., the same as <code>div</code> elements).</p>
					<p>This page will be updated once this change gets real-world implementation. For now, the
						guidance on this page remains current best practice.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Use the <code>aside</code> element for secondary material, such as sidebars. [[WCAG-1.3.1]]</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Include a heading for each aside [[WCAG-1.3.1]]</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Why don't sidebars need a role?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>aside</code> element, per the HTML specification definition, defines sidebars:</p>
						
						<blockquote>
							<p>The <code>aside</code> element represents a section of a page that consists of content 
								that is tangentially related to the content &#8230; [s]uch sections are often represented
								as sidebars in printed typography.</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<p>Adding an additional role will not improve the accessibility.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-002">What heading level should I use with asides?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although the positioning of supplementary content in the markup is not fixed in the
							same way as the primary narrative (i.e., where best to place the content is often
							a matter of choice), supplementary content always belongs to a section. For that reason,
							it should be treated as a subsection of the <code>section</code> that contains
							it. Consequently, the first heading level within an <code>aside</code> should always
							be one level lower than its containing section.</p>
						
						<p>For example, if a chapter has a heading in an <code>h2</code> tag, the headings of
							any sidebars within it should begin with <code>h3</code>. This helps ensure that
							users of assistive technologies can logically find these subsections of content when
							navigating by heading level. A user will not expect a sidebar to have an <code>h1</code>
							heading in such a scenario, as that would make it a higher-level content section.</p>
						
						<p>If a publisher cannot maintain heading numbering consistency, they should try to find
							another method that users can predict. For example, using <code>h6</code> for all
							sidebars. In this case, though, the publisher should instruct users on this convention;
							for example, in a section on how to use the ebook.</p>
						
						<p>While numbering gaps and inconsistent numbering of headings is technically not a failure
							of WCAG requirements, it also doesn't make for a great reading experience for users
							who need to move around by heading.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-003">Do sidebars require accessible names?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>It depends on how many there are in a document.</p>
						
						<p>If a document only has one <code>aside</code> element without a role, then an accessible
							name is not required.</p>
						
						<p>If there is more than one, however, then without an accessible name to differentiate them,
							users cannot determine which is which without navigating to each in turn.</p>
						
						<p>(Note that this is the same rule for adding accessible names that applies to any landmark
							role.)</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-004">Should I use <code>aside</code> or <code>article</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>aside</code> element is best used when the content is explains or expands on
							the primary narrative. It is most appropriate for sidebars, glossaries, and similar 
							explanatory content.</p>
						
						<p>The <code>article</code> element is best used when the content is independent from
							the other content of the document or publication. In a scientific journal, for example,
							each article is independent of the others, even if they have a common theme.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-005">Why don't all roles require an accessible name?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>When used on an <code>aside</code>, roles such as <code>doc-footnote</code> and
							<code>doc-pullquote</code> change the nature of the element from its default
							of a complementary landmark. Since the <code>aside</code> is no longer recognized
							as a complementary landmark when these roles are applied, it does not require an
							accessible name.</p>
						<p>When using roles, refer to their definitions to determine whether they require
							accessible names.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>The <code>aside</code> element was introduced in HTML5 to allow authors to identify secondary 
					content such as sidebars. When users of assistive technologies encounter an <code>aside</code>,
					the content is typically introduced as "complementary", allowing them to recognize that it is
					not part of the primary narrative.</p>
				
				<p>Prior to the introduction of this element, background coloring and borders were often the only way
					that secondary content was distinguished from the primary narrative. These methods are opaque to
					assistive technologies, however, so it was often confusing why the narrative would suddenly change
					when a sidebar did not have a heading, and was not always clear if a new section of primary content
					were beginning if it did have a heading.</p>
				
				<p>Using the <code>aside</code> element not only offers users the ability to skip the content when
					reading, but being complementary landmarks they are also able to easily find and return to the
					content after finishing the section. Each sidebar requires an accessible name for this feature
					to be most effective, otherwise users will not be able to distinguish one sidebar from the
					next.</p>
