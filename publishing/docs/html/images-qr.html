				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">What should I do with a QR code on the cover?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If a QR code is part of the front or back cover, make sure that users will be able to
							interact with the image long enough to scan it. Reading systems often only flash the front
							cover image while a book is loading, or show a thumbnail of it in the user's bookshelf.</p>
						<p>Placing the QR code in its own document in the reading order will make it more accessible.
							It will be the only content on the page, for example, which will make scanning easier for
							all users. Alternatively, incorporate it into the related front or back matter.</p>
						<p>If the QR code is kept as part of the cover, make sure that the cover image description
							indicates that there is a scannable code. Also, make sure that the cover image can be
							accessed long enough to scan it, typically by making it part of the linear reading order.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Quick Response (QR) codes have become ubiquitous in print media as a simple means of directing people
					to web sites. Users do not have to remember URLs or manually retype them into their mobile device's
					browser. They can just point the camera on their smart phone or tablet at the QR code and a scanner
					will read the embedded URL and offer to open the web site or app for them.</p>
				
				<p>QR codes are now commonly found in print books, especially on covers but also within the content.
					Some common uses include to direct users to:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>book reviews</li>
					<li>the author's biography, contact details, social media and web sites</li>
					<li>free previews, sales, and promotions</li>
					<li>additional works by the author or in the same genre</li>
					<li>interactive media such as images, audio, and video that accompany the book</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Although these kinds of links are essential to get users from print to digital, QR codes
					are making a presence in ebooks, as well, as reading devices are not always connected
					to the web and may lack the ability to open web links. QR codes are an effective means
					of getting users from static reading systems when done accessibly.</p>
				
				<p>Although QR codes offer some obvious benefits when a device is not connected to the internet,
					they also have some drawbacks, more so than with typical graphical images. In particular:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Blind users may not be able to ensure that the code is fully on the screen in order to
						scan it. With ebook reading systems, there is also the risk that the image will get split
						between page breaks.</li>
					<li>Users with low vision or color perception issues may not be aware that the image represents
						a scannable QR code if the code is not black and white.</li>
					<li>Users may not have another device to scan the code with, and users with mobility issues
						may not be able to hold a second device to scan it.</li>
					<li>The image may be too small or too far away from the user to effectively scan it.</li>
					<li>Users unfamiliar with the codes or with cognitive disabilities may struggle to understand
						what to do with them.</li>
				</ul>

					<h4>Accessibility considerations</h4>
					
					<p>To create accessible QR codes, the following issues need to be considered:</p>
					
					<dl>
						<dt>Contrast</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Although QR codes are most commonly black and white, this is not a requirement. Any color
								can be used for the QR code. If the contrast between the foreground and background is not
								sufficient, it is possible that some users may not be able to make out that there is a
								QR code present. Meeting the contrast requirements in WCAG success criterion 1.4.11 is
								a minimum for any QR code.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>Identification</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>If a user is not aware that an image represents a QR code, they will not know that they
								can interact with it. Ensure that the alt text for the image clearly indicates that it
								contains a QR code. For users with low vision, consider placing a border around the
								image to draw attention to it so it is not mistaken as decorative.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>Size</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The size of the QR code image can affect its usability. For one, if the image is too
								large or small, users may have trouble scanning it. The image may be blurry, or the code
								sequences might not be differentiable, if it is too small. Too large and users may have
								trouble fitting the code on screen to scan it, or a reading system might split the
								image to create a page break. The minimum recommended physical size for QR codes is
								often cited as 2cm by 2cm. For a digital code, this is roughly the equivalent of 76
								pixels by 76 pixels. (This size will easily meet both the minimum and enhanced target
								size requirements in WCAG success criteria 2.5.5 and 2.5.8 if the code is clickable.)</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>Usage</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Although QR codes have become more common, not everyone is familiar with how to use
								them. Users may get even more confused about what to do when they do not have a second
								device to scan the code with. This may require them to save the image to their local
								file system and open the image in a dedicated scanning application. While it is not
								expected that publishers can account for every scenario, some general instructions on
								how to use the QR code will help users unfamiliar with them.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>Alternatives</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Although QR codes can be effective for getting users from reading systems without
								internet connections, they are burdensome for users who are connected. Clicking a
								hyperlink is much simpler than scanning a code. This is especially true for users
								who cannot see the code or may have difficulties scanning it. Making the QR code
								clickable and/or providing a hyperlink in an extended description will help ensure
								that users can pick the most effective method for them. Ensuring that the URL
								contained in the code is the text of an alternative hyperlink also allows users to
								copy and paste it into a browser.</p>
