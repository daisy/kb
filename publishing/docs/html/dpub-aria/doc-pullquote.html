				<h3>Relation to ARIA</h3>

				<p><code>doc-pullquote</code> inherits its semantics from the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#none">none role</a> (i.e., it is presentational).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="usage">
				<h3>Usage</h3>

				<p>The role is typically used on <code>span</code> elements when the pullquote is tagged within the
					content of the publication (i.e., the text will be extracted and formatted later by script to make
					the presentational pullquote).</p>

				<p><code>doc-pullquote</code> is typically used on <code>blockquote</code>, <code>aside</code> and
						<code>div</code> elements when the quote is duplicated in a separate element. The addition of an
						<code>aria-hidden</code> attribute in these cases prevents the content from being read again to
					users of assistive technologies. A future version of ARIA is expected to introduce a new role for
					repeated content such as pullquotes that will allow them to be ignored by default but still be
					accessed by users interested in skimming the quotes.</p>

				<p><strong>Note:</strong> the ARIA 1.1 specification currently advises adding the backup role of
						<code>presentation</code> until support for <code>none</code> becomes more prevalent. As
						<code>doc-pullquote</code> inherits from <code>none</code>, the same advice applies for this
					role.</p>
				
				<p>For a simplified list of all the elements the role is allowed on, refer to the <a 
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-aria-authoring/#sec-mappings">mapping table</a> in the <a 
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA Role Authoring 
						Guide</a>. For the official list of allowed elements, refer to <a 
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/">ARIA in HTML</a>.</p>
