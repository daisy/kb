				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Avoid using the <code>hgroup</code> element as its semantics are not supported by browsers or assistive
					technologies.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="desc">
				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				<p>The <code>hgroup</code> element was created to try and solve the need for multi-level headings that act
					as a single unit. For example, it would allow a heading to be split onto three lines using separate
					heading tags of any type for each part, as in the following example.</p>
				<pre id="ex-01" class="linenums prettyprint"><code>&lt;hgroup>
   &lt;h2>Chapter&lt;/h1>
   &lt;h3>1&lt;/h1>
   &lt;h1>In the beginning&lt;/h1>
&lt;/hgroup></code></pre>
				<p>In theory, all the heading elements would be combined and treated as a single tag matching the highest
					heading level used in the group.</p>
				<p>The <code>hgroup</code> tag was designed as part of the HTML outline algorithm that neither browsers nor
					assistive technologies support. As a result, it does not do what its description suggests. Adding
					multiple headings just inserts multiple headings into the document and impedes navigation.</p>
				<p>Instead of the <code>hgroup</code> element, CSS can be used to split a heading over multiple lines and
					format each part separately (see the <a href="headings.html">headings knowledge base page</a>).</p>
				<p>The HTML 5.1 specification also includes a number of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/common-idioms-without-dedicated-elements.html#subheadings-subtitles-alternative-titles-and-taglines"
						>other approaches for expressing subheadings</a>.</p>
				<section id="epub">
					<h4>EPUB</h4>
					<p>Although support for the <code>hgroup</code> element was not included in EPUB 3.0 in accordance with
						the W3C HTML 5 specification, EPUB 3.2 now refers to the WhatWG version of HTML. As a result, it is
						valid to use the tag in publications.</p>
					<p>If <code>hgroup</code> is used, however, it <strong>must not contain more than one heading
							element</strong> to meet WCAG accessibility requirements. As a result, in most cases <strong>it is
							a redundant tag that should be omitted</strong>. The <a href="headings.html"><code>header</code>
							element</a> can be used to include a heading element with any other heading content.</p>
