				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Although using abbreviations and initialisms helps save space and can make for useful mnemonics,
					they also present a challenge for readers initially unfamiliar with the terms. This is especially
					problematic for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities, who may have trouble
					understanding and remembering the meanings.</p>
				
				<p>There are a variety of techniques that authors can use to make abbreviations and initialisms more
					accessible. A typical rule in most writing guides is to always provide the expanded version of
					the term before introducing the abbreviation in parentheses (e.g., "World Wide Web Consortium
					(W3C)".</p>
				
				<p>This technique works best on its own when an abbreviation or initialism is only used in a small
					section of the work. If the term is introduced once and then repeated throughout an entire
					publication, however, readers will have difficulty locating its definition.</p>
				
				<p>To avoid this problem, the HTML <code>abbr</code> element can be used to reintroduce the expansion
					by providing it in a <code>title</code> attribute (see <a href="#ex-02">example 2</a>). This markup
					provides an unobtrusive way to tag any instance of the abbreviation.</p>
				
				<p>A drawback of using the <code>abbr</code> element is that the expansion may only be available to
					users of assistive technologies. Although using the <code>title</code> attribute will produce a
					tooltip when a mouse is hovered over the abbreviation, readers may not be using a reading system
					with a pointing device.</p>
				
				<p>Another option is to link the abbreviation to a glossary entry (see <a href="#ex-03">example 4</a>).
					Although this option allows any user to reach the expansion, care needs to be exercised not to
					overload documents with links to glossary terms. The more repetitive links to a term there are in a
					document, the more it impedes users of assistive technologies from cycling through them. When using
					links, it is best to only link the first term in a section.</p>
