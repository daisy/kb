				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>A common problem when creating hyperlinks is that the text inside of the link does not provide the full
					context of what is being linked to. The assumption most people make is that links are only encountered
					where they are placed in the text, when in reality users can iterate over the links before, during and
					after reading a section. Without meaningful labels, the result can be a confusing mess of "see here" and
					"read more" link text being offered with no indication of where those links go.</p>
				
				<p>To avoid this problem, always ensure that the text you hyperlink is meaningful on its own. If you can read
					the link out of the context of its surrounding prose, and it clearly indicates where links to, you will
					improve the experience for users using ATs.</p>
				
				<p class="bridgehead">Overuse</p>
				
				<p>A more complicated issue with links is the number to include in a document. The more that you use, the
					more inconvenience it can cause to your users. For example, keyboard users may have to tab through all
					of the links to locate one they want to follow after finishing a section. Another problem is that linked
					text is often preceded by the word "link" being announced to the user, which can disrupt the reading
					experience when done in excess.</p>
				
				<p>The complicating factor is that generous hyperlinking can also be of benefit to many users, too.
					Keywords are often hyperlinked to their definitions, for example, which can quickly lead to tens and
					hundreds of hyperlinked words in a chapter. Although an impediment to some users, the ease of access
					often facilitates the process for users with learning disabilities and cognitive issues.</p>
				
				<p>Removing redundant links from EPUBs is a good idea, but what constitutes redundant linking has to be
					addressed on a case-by-case basis. Hyperlinking only the first instance of a keyword in each chapter
					might be one method of reducing the overall number, for example.</p>
				
				<p class="bridgehead">Perception</p>
				
				<p>Another problem with links is that they cannot always be perceived by a user (e.g., color blindness may
					make the links imperceptible from the surrounding text), in which case the person will not be aware that
					they are potentially missing access to additional information.</p>
				
				<p>To avoid the problem of links blending into their surroundings, hyperlinked text should be discoverable by
					more than just its color. Underlining of links is not required, but some other visual cue should be
					provided if underlines are removed (e.g., increased bolding of the font).</p>
				
				<p>Avoid overriding the color of visited links to make them match unvisited links, particularly in heavily
					cross-referenced works. A lack of visual distinguishment of where the user has already been can cause
					navigation problems for some users.</p>
				
				<p>It is also helpful when possible to alert users that clicking on a link will open a new window, as
					such changes in context can be disorienting for users.</p>
