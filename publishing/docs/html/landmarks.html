				<h3>Explanation</h3>

				<p>ARIA landmarks are used with web sites to allow users to identify and quickly move between the
					different primary regions of a page: site headers and footers, search boxes, advertisements, and the
					main content area.</p>

				<p>The landmarks found on a page are compiled by AT into a list of links. Users are expected to be able
					to quickly scroll through the landmarks in order to orient themselves to the page and access the
					specific section of content they are looking for.</p>

				<p>While publications are typically structured such that each document only contains the text of a
					single section or chapter, landmarks still play an important role in allowing users access to key
					components within one of these major regions (e.g., to quickly access notes, a glossary, learning
					objectives, practice problems, sidebars, or interactive widgets).</p>

				<p>Not every section of content in a publication needs to be a landmark, or should be. Landmarks should
					be reserved only for key sections that the user might need to access quickly. A user is more likely
					to appreciate being able to reach a glossary, for example, than have a listing of every section and
					subsection.</p>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/">DPUB-ARIA module</a> contains the following
					landmark roles for publications:</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Does every chapter/section need to be a landmark?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No.</p>
						
						<p>Landmarks should not be used as an alternative table of contents as they do no preserve the
							heading structure of the document. Try to limit the use of landmarks to the components within
							the page that a user would otherwise have to manually search for. Creating too many
							landmarks forces users to hunt through a long list.</p>

						<p>If the user wants to move by section heading or peruse the table of contents, options are
							already available to do so. Only identify the major section(s) of content within a document,
							if necessary (i.e., the chapters or top-level sections, not every subsection).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-008">Is every <code>section</code> with a heading a landmark?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No.</p>
						
						<p>A <code>section</code> tag is only a landmark when one or both of the following are true:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>It has a <code>role</code> attribute attached to it that specifies a landmark role.</li>
							<li>It has an <code>aria-label</code>, <code>aria-labelledby</code> or <code>title</code>
								attribute attached to it.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>In all other cases, a <code>section</code> has no specific semantic attached to it (i.e.,
							it is similar in nature to a <code>div</code>).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-009">Does every landmark require a label?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No.</p>
						
						<p><em>But</em>, the safest option is to always provide a label using one of the
							<code>aria-labelledby</code>, <code>aria-label</code> or <code>title</code> attributes.</p>
						
						<p>Technically, you only have to use these attributes when more than one of the same landmark
							role is present on the page (e.g., two or more <code>doc-chapter</code> or
							<code>doc-bibliography</code>). In these cases, the lack of a unique label can make it
							more difficult for users to find the one they are looking for. For example, if there are
							two indexes, without unique labels a user would not be able to determine which is the
							topical index and which the index of names without manually checking each.</p>
						
						<p>In workflows that combine data from different sources, or chunk content differently depending
							on the out, it is best practice to make the labels explicit. Doing so will avoid unintended
							violations of WCAG requirements.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-004">Should I use the <code>title</code> or <code>aria-label</code> attribute for
						hidden labels?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If a label is not available in the text, preference should always be given to the
							<code>aria-label</code> attribute. It has higher precedence in the calculation of
							accessible names for elements and controls and <code>title</code> has a history of poor
							support.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-002">Why should landmark names be unique?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>When there is more than one of the same landmark role in a document, providing unique names
							avoids confusion about which particular one is being accessed. Ideally, the title of each
							component will make clear its purpose, but if the same name is reused for each (e.g.,
							multiple "practice problem" sidebars), a unique identifier would improve the usability. The
							identifier should be something helpful, such as the subsection the component belongs to or
							the page it is found on in a print addition.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-003">What is the difference between ARIA landmarks and EPUB's landmarks/guide?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>ARIA landmarks are compiled for individual web pages, so they do not persist from one
							document to the next. As EPUB publications consist of many documents, reading systems need
							an effective way to locate key content across the entire publication. EPUB's <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-landmarks"
								>landmarks (EPUB 3)</a> and <a
								href="https://idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.6">guide</a> (EPUB 2)
							were designed to solve this problem of landmarks spread across many documents.</p>
						<p>For maximum interoperability, it is recommended to provide both types of landmarks.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-005">Why can't I use the <code>landmark</code> role?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <code>landmark</code> role is what the WAI-ARIA specification refers to as an <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#abstract_roles">abstract role</a>. It is not meant
							to be implemented directly, but used as the top-level definition from which the roles you
							can use inherit.</p>
						<p>For landmarks without a specific role, the <code>region</code> role can be used with an
							meaningful label.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-006">Why does <code>aside</code> require a label but not <code>section</code>?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Despite the best intentions when it was introduced, the <code>section</code> element has been
							used the same way as <code>div</code> (i.e., for purely stylistic reasons). As a result, the
							element does not have a default role to avoid this misuse disadvantaging users of assistive
							technologies.</p>

						<p>As a result, the following example <strong>is not a landmark</strong>, even though there is a
							heading:</p>

						<pre id="ex-05-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;section>
    &lt;h2>Section 3.1.1 &#8212; Elephants on Parade&lt;/h2>
    &#8230;
&lt;/section>
</code></pre>
						<p>If you assign a label to the element, however, it assumes the role of <code>region</code> and
							becomes a landmark:</p>


						<pre id="ex-06-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;section aria-labelledby="s311">
    &lt;h2 id="s311">Section 3.1.1 &#8212; Elephants on Parade&lt;/h2>
    &#8230;
&lt;/section>
</code></pre>

						<p>Conversely, the <code>aside</code> element has the implicit role of
								<code>complementary</code> so requires a label. For more information about the implicit
							roles of HTML elements, refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/">ARIA in
								HTML</a> document.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-007">Why can't I use landmarks on element X?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Some HTML elements are restricted in what roles they accept to prevent overriding necessary
							semantics.</p>

						<p>In particular, the <code>body</code> element has the special role <code>document</code> which
							cannot be overridden by any other role.</p>

						<p>Complete information about what roles are allowed on what elements is provided in the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/">ARIA in HTML</a> document.</p>
