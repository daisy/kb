				<p>The Accessible Publishing Knowledge Base covers a wide range of topics on the production of
					accessible digital publications. As a result, finding the page you need can sometimes be a
					challenge.</p>
				
				<p>There are two primary methods of locating information on the site:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Manually searching the categories for topics of interest.</li>
					<li>Using the site search feature for a deeper scan of the content.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If you have a good idea what area your problem falls under, the best place to start is by clicking
					on the corresponding category link in the category menu on the page (typically located on the
					right-hand side of each page). These links take you to a list of all topics covered in the
					knowledge base, and each topic contains a short description to help explain its purpose.</p>
					
				<p>The following list provides a brief explanation of each of the major categories:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Conformance</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="conformance/">accessibility conformance topics</a> provide information on meeting
							the various accessibility standards that apply to digital publications, such as the EPUB 
							Accessibility specification and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>CSS</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="css/">CSS topics</a> cover the accessible styling of content. These
							include issues with color perception, contrast, text resizing and spacing, and the
							reflowability of content.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>EPUB</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="epub/">EPUB topics</a> cover issues that are unique to the EPUB format.
							Accessibility  requirements of the EPUB package document are documented in this section, 
							for example.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Fixed Layouts</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="fxl/">fixed layouts topics</a> delve into issues with creating content
							that is laid out on pages with fixed dimensions (i.e., the content does not reflow to
							fit the screen but stays where it is positioned). This type of content rarely meets
							accessibility standards, but there are measures that publishers can take to help
							improve its readability.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>HTML</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="html/">HTML topics</a> cover a broad range of issues related to producing
							accessible HTML content. Guidelines include how to use elements and attributes accessibly,
							how to create common publishing structures such as indexes and glossaries accessibly, and
							how to apply ARIA roles, states, and properties.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="metadata/">metadata topics</a> describe the accessibility properties 
							available in widely used metadata standards such as schema.org and ONIX.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Navigation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="navigation/">navigation topics</a> describe how to author accessible 
							navigation aids such as the table of contents and page list.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Scripted Content and Forms</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="script/">scripting and forms topics</a> cover a range of issues related to
							adding interactive content to digital publications. Ensuring users can understand and 
							control this type of content is key to this area.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Synchronized Multimedia</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="sync-media/">synchronized multimedia topics</a> cover the creation of
							digital publications that provide synchronized text and audio playback, such as the
							EPUB 3 media overlays feature. These types of publications are often referred to as
							"read aloud" books.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Text to Speech</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="text-to-speech/">text-to-speech topics</a> cover technologies that aid
							in producing high-quality TTS playback.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="topic-note">
					<p id="topic-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>It is also possible to access a single page with <a href="topics.html">all the topics on the
						site</a>. The Site menu at the bottom of the page contains a link to this page.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>The search box at the top of each page also allows you to search for topics by keyword. It may
					return unrelated topics depending on what you are looking for, however, so it is often better to
					start by checking the appropriate category index first. The search feature is best if you are not
					sure where to start looking or did not find the information you were looking for in an existing
					topic.</p>
