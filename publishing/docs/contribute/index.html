				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>The DAISY knowledge base uses a very simply structured HTML page that allows authors to focus on
					writing new pages. All the formatting and additional content, like the menu bars, is inserted
					dynamically by script.</p>
				
				<p>This page provides a walk-thru of the process of starting a new page and submitting it for
					inclusion.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="clone">
				<h3>Where to Create</h3>
				
				<p>How you create a new page depends on what access you have to the <a
					href="https://github.com/daisy/kb">knowledge base repository in GitHub</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Trusted contributors with write access to the repository may create a new branch to work
					in. When you finish your contribution, simply open a new <a
						href="https://github.com/daisy/kb/pulls">pull request</a> to have the branch merged.</p>
				
				<p>For all other contributors, you will first need to create a <a
					href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>. You then have to <a
						href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">fork
						a copy the knowledge base repository</a> and then <a
							href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone
							it to your desktop</a> to work on.
					When you finish your contribution, you have to go to your forked repository in GitHub and <a
						href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">open
						a pull request</a> to have your changes added to the DAISY repository.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="template">
				<h3>Page Template</h3>
				
				<p>The cleanest way to begin a new page for the knowledge base is with the <a
					href="https://github.com/daisy/kb/tree/main/template/publishing/docs">blank template file</a>
					located in the templates directory of this repository. This file contains the minimum markup
					necessary to write a page.</p>
				
				<p>To begin creating a page, copy this template file to the most appropriate directory for the topic it
					will describe (e.g., a page describing an HTML markup technique would go in /publishing/docs/html)
					and give it a new short but meaningful file name.</p>
				
				<p>Please avoid using spaces in file names. Use hyphens to join multiple terms.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="page-meta">
				<h3>Page Metadata</h3>
				
				<p>After copy and renaming the template file, open it in an HTML editing program. Before beginning to
					write the new page, make sure to configure the necessary metadata in the document header.</p>
				
				<section id="page-title">
					<h4>Page Title</h4>
					
					<p>The first item that must be set is the page title. Type the new title between the
							<code>&lt;title>...&lt;/title></code> tags.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Do not</strong> insert the page title in the body of the page. The title you put in the
							<code>title</code> tags will automatically be inserted in the rendered page.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="pg-info">
					<h4>Page Info</h4>
					
					<p>The next step is to set the context information for the page. Look for the following script tag
						in the page header:</p>
					
					<pre id="info-ex-01" class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;script>
var page_info = {
   'topic': '...',
   'description': '...',
   'appliesTo': ['EPUB3']
};
&lt;/script></pre>
					
					<p>The <code>topic</code> field <strong>must</strong> be the uppercase name of the directory where
						you are creating the page. For example, if you are adding a new page to the html directory, you
						would set the field to:</p>
					
					<pre id="info-ex-02" class="prettyprint linenums">'topic': 'HTML',</pre>
					
					<p>If you are creating a new subdirectory for your page(s), you will need to make an array of values
						for the topic. For example, pages in the <code>html/dpub-aria</code> directory include an array
						like this:</p>
					
					<pre id="info-ex-03" class="prettyprint linenums">'topic': ['html', 'dpub-aria'],</pre>
					
					<p>The order of the array must match the order of the directories (i.e., parents before siblings).
						When your page is dynamically generated, this field provides the breadcrumb in the header (among
						other uses).</p>
					
					<p>The <code>description</code> field provides a short description of the purpose of the page. It is
						transformed into a <code>meta</code> description tag for search engine optimization.</p>
					
					<p>The <code>appliesTo</code> field is an array of values that identify which publishing
						technologies the page applies to. There are currently only three values that can be used with
						this field:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>EPUB3</li>
						<li>EPUB2</li>
						<li>Audiobooks</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>For a technique that is valid in both EPUB 2 and 3, the field would be:</p>
					
					<pre id="info-ex-04" class="prettyprint linenums">'appliesTo': ['EPUB3', 'EPUB2'],</pre>
					
					<p>Please list technologies by their relevance (e.g., list EPUB 3 before 2 because it is the current
						version of the standard).</p>
					
					<p>If additional technologies are required, please <a href="https://github.com/daisy/kb/issues">make
						a request</a> to have them added.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="pg-content">
				<h3>Page Content</h3>
				
				<p>After configuring the page metadata, the final step is to write the actual content of the page.</p>
				
				<p>Knowledge Base pages are structured to get information to users as quickly as possible. As most users
					will not stop to read extensive descriptions, pages begin with a brief summary of the purpose of the
					page. The relevant techniques are listed next, followed by a set of examples of the techniques in
					action. Lengthier descriptions of the issues and links to related resources are included at the end
					of the page.</p>
				
				<p>This section provides guidance on how to complete each these sections.</p>
				
				<p>Note that contributed pages should follow the default template for consistency with the rest of the
					site. There are times when the explanation of an issue will not fit this structure but please check
					in advance before deviating from it. Contributions that are too anomalous may be rewritten or
					rejected.</p>
				
				<section id="summary">
					<h4>Summary</h4>
					
					<p>The summary section should provide a brief recap of the key takeaway of the page. What is the key
						problem to be aware of, for example, or what technique must be followed. The summary should
						not be more than a sentence or two as it is meant to convey the key point as concisely as
						possible for users.</p>
					
					<p>The "Explanation" section described below is where you elaborate on the problems and
						solutions.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="techniques">
					<h4>Techniques</h4>
					
					<p>The techniques section is where you list the common measures to take to fix or avoid the issue
						covered by the page.</p>
					
					<p>Each list item should explain a practice in simple language and include a link to the relevant
						WCAG Success Criteria, when applicable, in brackets at the end.</p>
					
					<p>If there are specific WCAG techniques that users can follow, include these in a sub-list.</p>
					
					<p>For example, a technique explaining to include alternative text could be structured like
						this:</p>
					
					<pre id="tech-ex-01" class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;li>
   &lt;p>Provide alternative text in the &lt;code>alt&lt;/code> attribute
      if the image is not described in the surrounding text.
      &lt;span class="wcag-level">[&lt;a
         href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#non-text-content">WCAG
           1.1.1&lt;/a>]&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
   &lt;ul>
      &lt;li>&lt;a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37">Using
              alt attributes on img elements&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/ul>
&lt;/li></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section id="examples">
					<h4>Examples</h4>
					
					<p>Each page should provide users at least one example of how to implement the markup or feature
						in practice.</p>
					
					<p>Examples are structured using HTML <code>figure</code> tags.</p>
					
					<p>The first child element must be a <code>figcaption</code>. This element is further broken down
						into a title and description. The title goes in the <code>div</code> element with the
						<code>class</code> attribute value <code>label</code>. The description is written in one or
						more paragraphs after the title.</p>
					
					<p>The following example shows a typical structuring of an example caption:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ex-01" class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;figcaption>
   &lt;div class="label">Example 1 &#8212; Complex Images&lt;/div>
   &lt;p>This example uses the details element to &#8230;&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption></pre>
					
					<p>The markup for the example goes inside of a pairing of <code>pre</code> and <code>code</code>
						elements.</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ex-02" class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;pre id="ex-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;code>&#8230;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></pre>
					
					<p>Note that the <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes are required. These are used
						to add syntax highlighting and line numbers to the generated example.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="faqs">
					<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
					
					<p>The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is where you can address specific problems that are
						commonly encountered in a question-and-answer format. This approach is often easier for users to
						follow than reading an extended explanation. It also allows very specific problems to be
						addressed without overloading the more general explanation of the issue.</p>
					
					<p>The FAQ is structured using an HTML definition list (the <code>dl</code> element). Use a
							<code>dt</code> element for each question and a <code>dd</code> element for each answer.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="explanation">
					<h4>Explanation</h4>
					
					<p>The explanation section is where you describe in detail the practices and issues that users need
						to be aware of.</p>
					
					<p>There are no specific requirements for the explanation beyond being as thorough as possible and
						using as simple language as possible. Readers of the knowledge base are not necessarily
						technology experts.</p>
					
					<p>The explanation can be broken up into subsections if it helps to organize the information.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="links">
					<h4>Related Links</h4>
					
					<p>The related links section contains pointers to relevant standards so that users can quickly look
						up more information.</p>
					
					<p>If EPUB structures, HTML elements or ARIA attributes are referenced from the page, for example,
						provide links to their definitions in this section (even if the references are linked in the
						body).</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="other">
					<h4>Other Sections</h4>
					
					<p>If additional sections are needed, they should be added after the explanation and before the
						final related links section.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="update-idx">
				<h3>Updating Indexes</h3>
				
				<p>When adding a new page, both the topical and site indexes also need to be updated to include a link
					to the page.</p>
				
				<p>The topical index is located in the same folder as your page in the <code>index.html</code> file.
					This file includes a list of pages, typically in alphabetical order (although sometimes an overview
					or introductory page is listed first). Add a new entry in the list for your page.</p>
				
				<p>The site index is located in the <code>/docs</code> directory. It is an aggregate of all the topical
					indexes, so you can copy the entry you just made into the document. The only change necessary is to
					add the path to the file to the link since the page is not in the same directory as this index.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="view">
				<h3>Viewing Pages</h3>
				
				<p>If you open a new page in a browser by double-clicking on it from the file system you will only get
					the raw unstyled HTML.</p>
				
				<p>There are two ways to view pages as they will appear on the site.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>The first is to load the page from a local web server (e.g., IIS or Apache) running on your
							computer. To view your file, you only need to ensure that the root of the repository is the
							root web site on the server. You can then load the page in any browser to see the
							dynamically rendered version. The URL for the content folders is typically
								<code>http://localhost/publishing/docs/</code></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The second way is to commit the page to GitHub and view it online. Here, again, there are two
							approaches:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>If you have cloned the knowledge base to your local account, you can turn on GitHub
									pages to view the content. GitHub provides instructions on <a
										href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">how to turn on pages</a>. In
									this case, the URL for the content folders would be along these lines:
										<code>https://youraccountname.github.io/kb/publishing/docs/</code></p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>You can view the page through a third-party content server like statically.io. In
									GitHub, you first would navigate to where the page is located (e.g.,
									https://www.github.com/youraccountname/kb/publishing/docs/html/mynewpage.html). You
									then copy that URL and paste it into the <a
										href="https://statically.io/convert/">conversion tool</a> to get a new link you
									can use to view the page live.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
