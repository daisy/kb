				<p>The Accessible Publishing Knowledge Base was originally developed as a complement to the O'Reilly
					<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/accessible-epub-3/9781449329297/">Accessible EPUB 3</a>
					ebook published in 2012. It was a way to surface all the information that was collected as part of
					authoring that book but that could not all be added to it.</p>
				
				<p>The first iteration of the site was developed by DAISY and hosted on the (now retired) International
					Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) web site &#8212; the organization that was originally responsible
					for the creation and maintenance of the EPUB standard. The hybrid guidelines also came packaged as an
					EPUB publication.</p> 
				
				<p>When the IDPF merged with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DAISY took over hosting of the site
					and continued its role as maintainers of the content. The knowledge base has since grown to cover 
					an extensive range of topics on creating accessible digital publications. While still primarily
					rooted in making EPUB 3 publications accessible, the site is also a source of accessible practices for 
					EPUB 2 and also provides practical guidelines for creating accessible HTML content in 
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">W3C  Audiobooks</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The intervening years have also seen the publication of the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/">EPUB Accessibility specification</a>, which
					defines a formal framework for checking the accessibility of EPUB 3 publications. This site is now
					a primary source of information for producing content to meet this specification.</p>
