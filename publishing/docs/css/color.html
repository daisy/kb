				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Although the use of color is a common semantic method for conveying information to sighted users, it
					should never be used as the sole means of imparting information. Semantic markup should always
					underlie any use of border colors and shading so that the equal access is provided to users using
					non-visual playback methods.</p>

				<p>More generally, though, be sure to always cleanly separate styles from content. Separation of styling
					ensures that users can apply their own style sheets and/or use and built-in color, brightness and
					contrast controls in their user agent to tailor the display to their needs.</p>
				
				<p>But color is problematic for more than just the problems that arise conveying semantic meaning.
					Green text on red backgrounds (and vice-versa) can be unreadable for some people, and can generally
					cause what is known as visual vibrations. Red and black can also be indistinguishable to many
					users. Black text on bright white backgrounds can lead to eye strain and headaches.</p>
				
				<p>Likewise, placing one shade of a color on another is also going to make reading difficult, as will
					placing two light or dark colors on top of each other (luminosity).</p>
				
				<p>A user may be able to fix some of these issues with a configurable user agent, but it is better to
					avoid them in the first place.</p>
