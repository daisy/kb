				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Should I use multiple <code>dc:title</code> elements for series titles, subtitles, etc.?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although EPUB allows you to add more than one <code>dc:title</code> element, it is not
							recommended. Most reading systems only recognize the first title element they find.
							Readers consequently may not have access to the other titles.</p>
						
						<p>While this may not be problematic in many cases, if the series title is the first
							title in the metadata, then all books in the series could end up with the same name
							in the user's bookshelf (e.g., all three parts of the Lord of the Rings could end up named
							"The Lord of the Rings" in the bookshelf if the unique book titles are in separate elements).</p>
						
						<p>EPUB 3 tried to address having multiple <code>dc:title</code> elements by adding the
							<code>title-type</code> and <code>display-seq</code> properties to specify more information
							about the type of title and how to display it, but reading systems largely ignore these
							properties.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>A title is a required element in all versions of EPUB. It is expressed in the package document's metadata
					section in a Dublin Core <code>title</code> element.</p>
				
				<p>This title is typically used to identify the publication in reading systems (vendor systems may use other
					metadata, such as that supplied directly by publishers). The title enables the user not only to know what
					publication they have in their bookshelf or library but allows the publication to be easily found again.</p>
				
				<p>When authors omit a title, reading systems will normally generate a generic name, such as "Untitled."
					The more publications like this a user loads, the harder it becomes to distinguish which is which.</p>
