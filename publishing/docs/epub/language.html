				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Setting the language of a publication is an important step in ensuring its accessibility as it helps
					assistive technologies pronounce the text correctly. Without language declarations, assistive
					technologies will read the text in the default language of the user. This can lead to the entire
					text being mispronounced (when reading a publication in another language) or individual phrases
					being mangled (for inline foreign phrases).</p>
				
				<p>This tutorial covers how to set the language in the EPUB package document as well as in XHTML and
					SVG content documents so that the information is available to assistive technologies and reading
					systems.</p>
				
				<section id="lang-tags">
					<h4>What are language tags</h4>
					
					<p>Before we can get into the mechanisms for setting the language, it is important to first
						understand what you are setting. Languages are declared using <dfn>language tags</dfn>, which
						are hyphen-separated codes that identify the language, region, script, etc.</p>
					
					<p>At a minimum, each language tag consists of a primary language, which is a two- or
						three-character code that identifies the language.</p>
					
					<p>The following table lists some common language codes:</p>
					
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Code</th>
								<th>Language</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>de</td>
								<td>German</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>en</td>
								<td>English</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>he</td>
								<td>Hebrew</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>hi</td>
								<td>Hindi</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>ko</td>
								<td>Korean</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					
					<p>For the complete list of language codes, refer to the <a 
						href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">IANA
						language registry</a> (search for the language's name to find its code).</p>
					
					<p>For many languages, all that you have to specify is the primary language code. For others with
						regional dialects, however, you can add an additional region subtag for more precision.</p>
					
					<p>American and British pronunciations, for example, can differ significantly, but a code of
						"<code>en</code>" will not inform an assistive technology which to apply when it matters (e.g.,
						when reading an American or British novel where the characters talk in regional dialects).
						Adding the region solves this problem as it allows the assistive technology to pick a more
						appropriate voice for playback.</p>
					
					<p>The region subtag is added to the language using a hyphen. For example, "en-US" indicates that
						the text is in English as spoken in the US.</p>
					
					<p>The following table lists some common language tags with their region subtags:</p>
					
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Code</th>
								<th>Language</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>en-UK</td>
								<td>British English</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>en-US</td>
								<td>US English</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>fr-CA</td>
								<td>French as spoken in Canada</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>fr-FR</td>
								<td>French as spoken in France</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					
					<p>Note that although it is common convention to capitalize region tags, this is not a requirement.
						Language tags are processed case-insensitively.</p>
					
					<p>You can also specify the script the text is written in using a script subtag. Simplified and
						traditional Chinese, for example, can be differentiated using the "zh-Hans" and "zh-Hant"
						script tags. You should only use script subtags when a language is commonly written in more
						than one script.</p>
					
					<p>For a more in-depth explanation of language tags, refer to the W3C article <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/#extlang">Language tags in HTML
						and XML</a>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="lang-declarations">
					<h4>Language declaration mechanisms</h4>
					
					<p>With an understanding now of what language tags are, it is time to turn to how to express those
						tags in markup languages.
					
					<p>In XML-based markup languages, like XHTML, SVG and the EPUB package document, the standard
						mechanism for declaring the language of the text is the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute, where
						the value of this attribute is a language tag.</p>
					
					<p>Best practice is to always declare a language on the root element (i.e., the element that
						contains all the other markup). For example, the language of an XHTML document can be specified
						as follows:</p>
					
					<pre class="example prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en-US">
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
					
					<p>Language information is inherited, so by setting the attribute on the root element you
						automatically declare the language for all the elements and text in the document.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="lang-override">
					<h4>Overriding the language</h4>
					
					<p>Not all publications are written in a single language. Multilingual publications may switch
						between languages often, while other publications may contain short phrases or single words in
						another language.</p>
					
					<p>To indicate a change of language, you only need to declare the new language on a tag that
						surrounds the foreign text. The change in language only exists within that tag, as shown in the
						following example:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-over-01-src" class="example prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;p xml:lang="en">
    This is in English
    &lt;span xml:lang="fr">mais ceci en fran&ccedil;ais&lt;/span>
    and back to English again.
&lt;/p></code></pre>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="over-html-note-01">
						<p id="over-html-note-01" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>The <code>lang</code> attribute is omitted from these XHTML examples for clarity. Refer to
							the <a href="#lang-attr">section on <code>lang</code> in XHTML and SVG</a> for why it is
							useful to include.</p>
					</div>	
					
					<p>The text of markup documents always inherits the language of the nearest ancestor tag with a
						language declaration, so there is no limit on how many times the language can change:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-over-02-src" class="example prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;p xml:lang="en">
    English
    &lt;span xml:lang="fr">
       French
       &lt;span xml:lang="es">Spanish&lt;/span>
       French
    &lt;/span>
    English
&lt;/p></code></pre>
					
					<p>It is important to indicate when the primary language changes so that text-to-speech engines can
						pronounce the foreign language phrases correctly. Without the correct language information they
						will try to pronounce the text according to the rules for the default language.</p>
					
					<p>It is not necessary to indicate a language change for terms and phrases that have become part of
						the default language, however. Words like "caf&eacute;" and "coup d'&eacute;tat", although
						French in origin, are now considered common English phrases. Text-to-speech engines can
						typically handle these words as English.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="package-lang">
					<h4>Setting the package document language</h4>
					
					<p>As an EPUB publication is a collection of documents, there are multiple places where the
						language of the content must be specified. The first spot we will look at is the package
						document.</p>
					
					<p>The package document is central to an EPUB publication as it contains the metadata about the
						work, the resources that belong to it, and how to order those resources into a reading order.
						As you may have guessed already, because the package document contains metadata such as the
						title and author names, it is important to tell reading systems what language this information
						is in.</p>
					
					<p>The most common way to do this is to declare a language tag on the <code>package</code> element,
						as in the following example:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-pkg-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;package &#8230; xml:lang="en"></code></pre>
					
					<p>Because the <code>package</code> element is the root element (i.e., it contains all the other
						elements), the language you specify on this element will apply to all the metadata it contains.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="pkg-note-02">
						<p id="pkg-note-02" class="label">Note</p>
						
						<p>EPUB 2 does not allow a global language declaration using the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute
							on the <code>package</code> element. You must declare an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on
							every metadata tag.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>With a global language declaration on the <code>package</code> element, you only need to override
						that declaration if metadata is written in another language. For example, if the book is a translation,
						you can indicate the language of the author's name by adding a language declaration to their
						<code>dc:creator</code> tag:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-pkg-02-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;dc:creator xml:lang="fr">Albert Camus&lt;/dc:creator></code></pre>
					
					<p>One limitation of the package document metadata is that it is not possible to override the
						language of the text within a metadata tag. If you have a title that includes a
						foreign-language term or phrase, for example, you cannot identify that that text is in a
						different language. It will have to be read in the default language for the tag.</p>
					
					<p>Note that it is rarely helpful to use region codes (e.g., adding "-US" for American English) in
						the package document metadata. Users will typically expect to hear the metadata announced in
						their preferred regional dialect.</p>
					
					<p>Setting the language of the package document metadata is only the first step in defining the
						needed language information for reading systems. It is also necessary to specify the language
						of the publication content in the package document, as is covered in the next section.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="pkg-note-01">
						<p id="pkg-note-01" class="label">Note</p>
						
						<p>EPUB does not currently have a method for adding translations of metadata. Consider the following
							two titles:</p>
						
						<pre id="ex-pkg-03-src" class="example prettyprint"><code>&lt;dc:title>King Lear&lt;/dc:title>
&lt;dc:title xml:lang="fr">Le roi Lear&lt;/dc:title></code></pre>
						
						<p>A reading system will treat second title as a French subtitle (if it recognizes it at all).
							It is possible, however, to provide metadata in an alternate script using the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-alternate-script"><code>alternate-script</code></a>
							property.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="publication-lang">
					<h4>Setting the publication language</h4>
					
					<p>Although the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute specifies the language of the package document
						metadata, it does not tell reading systems the language of the content of the publication.
						The language of the metadata and content is often the same, but there are good reasons why a
						separate method of specifying this is included. For example, the work may be multilingual, or
						it may be written in a specific regional dialect.</p>
					
					<p>EPUB requires authors to include at least one <code>dc:language</code> tag in the package
						document metadata to identify the primary language(s) of the content. Like with the
						<code>xml:lang</code> attribute, the value of this element is a language code:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-dc-src" class="example prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;dc:language>es&lt;/dc:language></code></pre>
					
					<p>If a publication is written in more than one language (e.g., a new language learning guide), you
						can repeat the <code>dc:language</code> element for each language (refer to <a 
							href="#ex-02">example 2</a>). Do not place all the languages into a single tag. The order
						in which you list the languages indicates their primacy (i.e., the first
						<code>dc:language</code> element defines the primary language of the work).</p>
					
					<p>The language information contained in the <code>dc:language</code> tags is only informative,
						however. Setting this property helps reading systems optimize the rendering of the publication.
						They might use this information to preload a language-specific dictionary, for example, or to
						preload a text-to-speech engine so that users do not encounter a delay when they try to voice
						the content. It is still necessary to set both the <a href="#package-lang">language of the 
							package document metadata</a> and the <a href="#package-lang">language of each content 
								document</a> in the publication.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="xhtml-lang">
					<h4>Setting the content language</h4>
					
					<p>Although language settings in the package document are important to set, it is even more
						critical to specify the language of each content document. The information set in the package
						document does not automatically filter down.</p>
					
					<p>Setting the language of XHTML and SVG content documents, the two primary formats EPUB supports,
						is no different than setting the language in the package document. The primary language of the
						documents is set on the respective root element of each document (refer to <a
							href="#ex-04">example 4</a>). You can then indicate that terms and phrases are in another
						language by wrapping them in any of HTML's or SVG's various tags.</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-content-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en" lang="en">
   &#8230;
   &lt;body>
      &#8230;
      &lt;p>
          As the French would say, there is a
          certain "&lt;span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">je ne
          sais quoi&lt;/span>" about the way that &#8230;
      &lt;/p>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="doc-note-01">
						<p id="doc-note-01" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>For more information about setting the language in XHTML documents, refer to the <a
						href="../html/lang.html">HTML Language</a> topic in the knowledge base.</p>
					</div>
					
					<section id="lang-attr">
						<h5>The <code>lang</code> attribute</h5>
						
						<p>Although you are only required to use the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute with XHTML
							and SVG documents, it is best practice to also add a <code>lang</code> attribute. When
							doing so, the language tag expressed in the <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>lang</code>
							attributes must match. For example:</p>
						
						<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"></code></pre>
						
						<p>The reason it is recommended to add both attributes is that XHTML and SVG documents
							in EPUB publications may not always be processed as XML, despite the requirements of the
							standard. A browser-based reading system might, for example, default to processing all the
							XHTML documents as regular HTML. In this case, HTML processors ignore the
							<code>xml:lang</code> attribute as they only recognize the <code>lang</code> attribute. By
							always adding both attributes, you help ensure that the correct language information is
							available to users regardless of how the document is processed.</p>
