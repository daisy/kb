				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="ec-note-01">
					<p id="ec-note-01" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Instructions on how to obtain and configure a system to run EPUBCheck are available from the <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/wiki">EPUBCheck Usage wiki</a> This page does not
						cover installation issues.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3 id="start-hd">Getting Started</h3>
				
				<p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases">EPUBCheck</a> is a free command-line validation
					tool that automatically checks EPUB publications for conformance to the standard. It reports issues
					that are in violation of the requirements of the standard and/or that could cause a publication not
					to open or render in reading systems.</p>
				
				<p>The EPUBCheck program is written as a Java library, so running it requires some basic knowledge of
					entering instructions from a command-line interface. Which interface to use depends on the operating
					system. On Windows, both the Command Prompt (<code>cmd.exe</code>) and PowerShell
						(<code>powershell.exe</code>) can be used to run EPUBCheck. On Macs, the Terminal app can be
					used.</p>
				
				<p>When starting a new command-line interface, the starting directory is usually listed before the input
					prompt:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">C:\users\default>_</pre>
				
				<p>Although EPUBCheck can be run from almost any directory, it is often simpler to change directories to
					where the publication to be validated is located to avoid entering lengthy file paths. The
						<code>cd</code> command is used to change the directory.</p>
				
				<p>The following command will change the command line interface to the <code>c:\epubs</code>
					directory:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">> cd c:\epubs</pre>
				
				<p>The command to run EPUBCheck is the same regardless of the operating system used. It consists of the
						<code>java</code> command followed by two arguments:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><code>-jar path\to\epubcheck.jar</code> &#8212; The first argument is a reference to the Java
						jar file (<code>epubcheck.jar</code>) that contains the EPUBCheck program. The exact path used
						to reference this file depends on where EPUBCheck is installed and what directory EPUBCheck is
						run from.</li>
					
					<li><code>publication.epub</code> &#8212; The second argument is the name of the packaged EPUB
						publication to check. The full path to the file has to be specified if it is not in the same
						directory where EPUBCheck is run.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>The following is an example of how EPUBCheck could be called from the command line to validate the
						<code>accessible_epub_3.epub</code> file:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">> java -jar c:\epubcheck\epubcheck.jar c:\epubs\accessible_epub_3.epub</pre>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="ec-note-02">
					<p id="ec-note-02" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Full paths to the <code>epubcheck.jar</code> file and publication to be checked are omitted from
						the rest of the examples on this page for readability purposes.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>If EPUBCheck does not detect any problems, it will emit a series of messages like the following:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">Validating using EPUB version 3.2 rules.
No errors or warnings detected.
Messages: 0 fatals / 0 errors / 0 warnings / 0 infos

EPUBCheck completed</pre>
				
				<p>The first line specifies what version of EPUB is being validated. In the case of the preceding
					example, the progam is checking against the requirements of EPUB 3.2.</p>
				
				<p>The next line two lines indicate that no issues were found, but this is where any issues will be
					reported when there are problems.</p>
				
				<p>The final statement just confirms that the program has terminated successfully.</p>
				
				<p>A clean validation result is preferred outcome before moving on to check the accessibility of a
					publication. In practice, however, EPUBCheck will often uncover warnings and errors that need fixing
					first.</p>
				
				<p>The following is an example of a report containing a markup error:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">Validating using EPUB version 3.2 rules.
ERROR(RSC-005): accessible_epub_3.epub/EPUB/ch01.xhtml(98,5): Error while
parsing file: element "p" not allowed here; expected the element end-tag

Check finished with errors
Messages: 0 fatals / 1 error / 0 warnings / 0 infos

EPUBCheck completed</pre>
				
				<p>The EPUBCheck error message identifies both the file containing the error
						(<code>accessible_epub_3.epub/EPUB/ch01.xhtml</code>) as well as the line number
						(<code>98</code>) and character offset (<code>5</code>) where it occurs. It also provides a
					brief message explaining the problem &#8212; in this case, a <code>p</code> tag is used where it is
					not allowed, as shown in the following screen grab of the file:</p>
				
				<img src="../../graphics/epubcheck/epubcheck-markup-error.png"
					alt="A p tag is included after the closing body tag" width="450" />
				
				<p>Unfortunately, not every message is as easy to understand as this one, and there are times when
					EPUBCheck will not provide useful a line number or character offset (e.g., it often reports
						<code>(-1,-1)</code> when a problem cannot be traced to a specific location). As a result,
					fixing errors will often require some sleuth work.</p>
				
				<p>The message counts that EPUBCheck outputs is more of a convenience for tracking that problems are
					being solved between runs, as the numbers reported can often be misleading.</p>
				
				<p>For example, one markup error could be the cause of many other errors, so fixing one problem can lead
					to many or all the other problems disappearing. It is recommended to re-validate publications often
					when fixing bugs to avoid spending time look for problems that have already been solved.</p>
				
				<p>It is also not the case that every issue that EPUBCheck raises has to be fixed, as will be covered in
					the next section on message severity.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="messages">
				<h3>Message Severity</h3>
				
				<p>EPUBCheck reports five different categories of messages &#8212; four are output by default and one
					type, <a href="#arg-usage">usage messages</a>, has to be turned on in the arguments. These
					categories reflect the severity of the problem being reported, ranging from fatal at the highest to
					info at the lowest.</p>
				
				<p>Each issue raised by EPUBCheck starts with one of these labels:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">WARNING(OPF-053): 30/accessible_epub_3.epub/EPUB/package.opf(9,29): Date value 'Tuesday' does not follow recommended syntax ...
ERROR(RSC-005): 30/accessible_epub_3.epub/EPUB/ch01.xhtml(91,19): Error while parsing file: attribute "border" not allowed here ...</pre>
				
				<p>The severity is followed by an error code in parentheses, but these codes can typically be ignored.
					They are an internal classification system used by the program and not helpful outside of debugging
					issues with EPUBCheck itself.</p>
				
				<p>A summary of the total number of each is type provided when EPUBCheck finishes validating:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">Messages: 2 fatals / 4 error / 18 warnings / 1 infos / 147 usages</pre>
				
				<p>The meaning of each category is explained in the following list.</p>
				
				<dl class="value">
					<dt>Fatal</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Fatal errors are emitted for the most severe problems. A fatal error is one that will prevent
							reading systems from opening a publication (e.g., packaging problems), or that will prevent
							the content from being readable (e.g., critical xml errors in the content).</p>
						
						<p>Fatal errors must be corrected to ensure the usability of the publication.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Error</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Errors represent the next lower severity level. Errors identify where a publication deviates
							from the requirements of the EPUB standard. They typically will not prevent an EPUB
							publication from being opened, but they often lead to unintended consequences (e.g., content
							not rendering as expected).</p>
						
						<p>Errors typically need to be corrected to ensure the usability of the publication, but some
							format-specific errors do not affect the accessibility (see the note on <a
								href="#wcag-req">understanding errors in relation to WCAG</a>).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Warning</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Warnings are a level below Errors. They identify deviations from recommended practices in the
							EPUB standard. A publication with warnings is not invalid, and may have no unintended
							rendering issues, but not following recommended practices can lead to interoperability
							issues.</p>
						
						<p>Warnings do not have to be corrected, but it is generally advised to follow recommended
							practices. Many vendors will not accept publications with warnings.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Info</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Info messages are the lowest level message output by default by EPUBCheck. These messages
							usually provide alerts about issues with EPUBCheck itself (e.g., that it might not be able
							to decrypt a file to check it, or that a potential issue is under discussion). They are not
							common.</p>
						
						<p>Info messages do not necessarily require any action but are important to review to discover
							what EPUBCheck has had a problem with.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Usage</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Usage messages are like best practices: they identify preferred practices, but it is not
							strictly necessary to follow the guidance. Depending on the publication, EPUBCheck may emit
							a large number of these messages so they are turned off by default.</p>
						
						<p>To get a list of usage messages, the usage flag (<code>-u</code>) has to be set when
							starting EPUBCheck.</p>
						
						<p>It is not required to fix all usage messages, but consideration should be given to following
							the best practices they highlight.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<div role="note" class="note" id="wcag-req" aria-labelledby="wcag-note">
					<p id="wcag-note" class="label">WCAG Parsing Requirements</p>
					
					<p>Although it is generally best practice to fix any errors in an EPUB publication, WCAG does not
						enforce strict validity &#8212; not all errors are critical to the accessible reading of
						content.</p>
					
					<p>WCAG only requires invalid content be fixed where the errors or warnings are from problems that
						will cause accessibility issues. Some examples include:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>duplicate IDs that break ARIA attribute references (e.g., in custom controls or description
							links);</li>
						<li>duplicate IDs that break control labels or table headings;</li>
						<li>more than one <code>role</code> attribute specified on an element.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In the past, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#parsing">success criterion 4.1.1</a> was used
						as a catch-all for HTML parsing errors (i.e., well-formedness errors) that could affect the
						ability of assistive technologies to process a document. As modern HTML parsing now
						standardizes the method for handling these well-formedness errors, 4.1.1 always passes
						conformance evaluations. Parsing errors that affect the accessibility of publications, such as
						those described above, are covered by other success criteria and should be reported under their
						more applicable success criterion.</p>
					
					<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../../wcag/parsing.html">explainer for success
						criterion 4.1.1</a>.</p>

			<section id="arg">
				<h3>Arguments</h3>
				
				<p>An argument is an additional option that can be specified when EPUBCheck is run. Arguments are
					typically included after calling the EPUBCheck jar file and before specifying the publication or
					file to validate.</p>
				
				<p>The following example shows how to request that EPUBCheck include usage messages in its output using
					the <code>-u</code> argument:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -u accessible_epub_3.epub</pre>
				
				<p>Many of EPUBCheck's arguments have both a verbose and compact form. The verbose form has two dashes
					in front of the name, while the compact is a single dash followed by a letter. Having EPUBCheck
					output usage messages can be accomplished either using the compact <code>-u</code> argument, as in
					the last example, or the verbose <code>--usage</code>. 
				
				<p>Although EPUBCheck includes many arguments that allow it to be run in different ways and for
					different purposes, this section only identifies some of the most useful.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="arg-note">
					<p id="arg-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>For a complete list of all the arguments EPUBCheck accepts, run the program with only the help
							(<code>-h</code>) argument: <code>java -jar epubcheck.jar -h</code></p>
				</div>
				
				<dl class="value">
					<dt id="arg-version">Version (<code>-v</code>)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The version argument is used to specify what version of EPUB to validate against. It takes
							either the value "<code>2.0</code>" or "<code>3.0</code>" to indicate whether the content
							conforms to EPUB 2 or EPUB 3:</p>
						
						<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -v 2.0 ...</pre>
						
						<p>It is not necessary to specify this argument when validating full publications as EPUBCheck
							will automatically determine the correct version from the package document. It is typically
							paired with the <a href="#mode">mode argument</a> to validate individual files within a
							publication.</p>
						
						<p>The version argument <strong>does not</strong> have a verbose form. The use of
								<code>--version</code> is reserved for discovering which version of EPUBCheck is
							installed.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="arg-mode">Mode (<code>--mode</code> or <code>-m</code>)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUBCheck is capable of running on more than just packaged EPUB files. The mode argument is
							used in these cases to guide the program to the correct type of validation to perform.</p>
						
						<p>The mode argument is typically paired with a <a href="#version">version argument</a> as in
							the following example for validating an EPUB 2 package document:</p>
						
						<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode opf -v 2.0 package.xml</pre>
						
						<p>The various mode values are explained in the following list.</p>
						
						<dl>
							<dt id="mode-opf">opf</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>opf</code> value indicates that an EPUB 2 or 3 package document is to be
									validated.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode opf -v 3.0 package.xml</pre>
							</dd>
							
							<dt id="mode-xhtml">xhtml</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>xhtml</code> value indicates that an EPUB 2 or 3 XHTML content document is
									to be validated.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode xhtml -v 3.0 chapter01.xhtml</pre>
							</dd>
							
							<dt id="mode-svg">svg</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>svg</code> value indicates that an EPUB 2 or 3 SVG content document is to
									be validated.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode svg -v 2.0 heart.svg</pre>
							</dd>
							
							<dt id="mode-nav">nav</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>nav</code> value indicates that an EPUB 3 navigation document is to be
									validated.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode nav nav.xhtml</pre>
								
								<p>EPUBCheck <strong>does not</strong> validate individual EPUB 2 NCX documents.</p>
							</dd>
							
							<dt id="mode-mo">mo</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>mo</code> value indicates that an EPUB 3 media overlays is to be validated.
									EPUB 2 does not have an equivalent feature.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode mo chapter01.smil</pre>
							</dd>
							
							<dt id="mode-exp">exp</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The <code>exp</code> value is used to indicate that an unpackaged EPUB 2 or 3
									publication is to be validated (i.e., the contents are "expanded" in their own
									directory). In this mode, the directory containing the unzipped files is used
									instead of a file name.</p>
								
								<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode exp accessible_epub_3</pre>
								
								<p>It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to specify the version argument for expanded
									EPUB validation, as EPUBCheck will automatically determine the version from the
									package document.</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="arg-usage">Usage Messages (<code>--usage</code> or <code>-u</code>)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>As covered in the section on <code>message severity</code>, usage messages are not turned on
							by default. The usage argument must be specified to enable them.</p>
						
						<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -u accessible_epub_3.epub</pre>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="arg-save">Save (<code>--save</code> or <code>-s</code>)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The save argument provides a helpful option to create a packaged EPUB file from an expanded
							directory, avoiding the troubles that can arise from manually zipping an EPUB. It only works
							when the <a href="#mode-exp">expanded mode argument</a> is specified:</p>
						
						<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar -mode exp -s accessible_epub_3</pre>
						
						<p>If EPUBCheck completes without any fatal error or error messages, it will put a copy of the
							zipped EPUB file in the same directory that contains the folder with the publication (e.g.,
							if run on the folder <code>c:\epubs\accessible_epub_3</code> the saved file will be located
							at <code>c:\epubs\accessible_epub_3.epub</code>).</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

			<section id="output">
				<h3>Redirecting Output</h3>
				
				<p>Reading the output from EPUBCheck in a command-line window can be a challenge, especially when there
					are a lot of messages to work through. Fortunately, all command-line interfaces have a feature that
					allows the output from a program to be captured and redirected to a file. Reading EPUBCheck messages
					in a text editor is much simpler, as line wrap can be turned off and the text is more easily
					scrolled and searched.</p>
				
				<p>To redirect the output of EPUBCheck, a greater-than character (<code>&gt;</code>) is used at the end
					of the command followed by the file to redirect the output to.</p>
				
				<p>The following command will redirect the output to the file <code>output.txt</code>:</p>
				
				<pre class="console">> java -jar epubcheck.jar accessible_epub_3.epub > output.txt</pre>
				
				<p>Other than outputting to a directory that can be written to (e.g., operating systems do not allow
					writing files into special system directories), there are no restrictions on the output file's name
					or path.</p>
				
				<p>Each time EPUBCheck is run this way it will overwrite the previous file with the new results so it is
					not necessary to specify a new file name each time. Many text editors will automatically reload the
					new output when EPUBCheck exits, too, further simplifying the process.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="limitations">
				<h3>Limitations</h3>
				
				<p>Although EPUBCheck is capable of capturing the most serious usability issues that can arise with EPUB
					publications, it has a number of limitations on what it can effectively check. These include:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>It provides only limited validation of some technologies, notably CSS, which could cause issues
						with the presentation.</li>
					
					<li>It is not able to verify whether scripts will negatively affect the structure or usability of a
						publication.</li>
					
					<li>It does not include many accessibility-related checks. Those that it does, like the correct use
						of ARIA roles, states and properties, may not be complete due to complexities in the code used
						to check them.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>As a result, manual checking of EPUBs for usability in reading systems is always recommended.</p>
				
				<p>And, more importantly, to ensure the accessibility of publications, the <a href="ace.html">Ace</a>
					and <a href="smart.html">SMART</a> tools also need to be run. Refer to their respective pages in the
					knowledge base for more information on testing for accessibility.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="alt">
				<h3>Alternatives</h3>
				
				<p>If the idea of running EPUBCheck from the command line is overwhelming, there are simpler options
					available. The following are some commonly used alternatives:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://validator.idpf.org/">EPUB Validator</a> &#8212; A free online validator
						maintained by the DAISY Consortium. Uploaded files are validated against EPUBCheck and the
						results are returned in a new web page. (Not for commercial publishing use.)</li>
					
					<li><a href="https://ebookflightdeck.com/">FlightDeck</a> &#8212; A web-based commercial validator
						that also focuses on vendor-specific content rules. Includes additional helpful information on
						how to solve EPUBCheck errors.</li>
					
					<li><a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html">Oxygen Editor</a> &#8212; A commercial file
						editor that includes a built-in version of EPUBCheck for checking packaged EPUB publications.
						The program also provides real-time validation and code completion for EPUB-specific files, such
						as the package document and container file.</li>
					
					<li><a href="https://www.pagina.gmbh/produkte/epub-checker/">Pagina EPUB-Checker</a> &#8212; A
