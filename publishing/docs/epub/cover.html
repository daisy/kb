				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Should I preface the alternative text with "Cover: "?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>While this is a useful convention for identifying that the image is of a cover, it is not
							strictly necessary now that the <code>doc-cover</code> role exists, and may cause duplication
							going forward. Assistive technologies should identify that the image is the cover from the
							presence of this role. Support for the role is not yet widespread, however, so continued use
							of the preface is acceptable.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Cover images often convey important information about a publication - more than just the
					title and author. A cover might give additional context, such as the publication's relation
					to other works. It might include a image by which the publication is commonly known
					(e.g., professors often refer to textbooks by key features on their covers).</p>
				
				<p>Despite the importance of cover images, it is still common to find them described only 
					by the unhelpful alternative text "cover image". Doing so disadvantages any user who cannot
					see the image, since they will not be able to determine if the publication matches a colloquial
					description.</p>
				
				<p>For this reason, it is recommended to include as much pertinent information as possible about
					the cover in its alternative. Including any text content represented in the image is a good
					starting point, but also include a short description of the cover image itself, whenever applicable
					(e.g., some covers may not include an image, but just be a solid color).</p>
				
				<p>Sometimes a lengthier description of the cover is necessary, such as when a cover shows a picture
					of an painting, artifact or antiquity.</p>
				
				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 3</h4>
					
					<p>EPUB 3 also allows the cover image to be identified in the package document by adding the value 
						<code>cover-image</code> to the <code>properties</code> attribute of the manifest 
						<code>item</code> for the image (see <a href="#ex-03">example 3</a>).</p>
					
					<p>When provided, this image is commonly used by EPUB reading systems for display to the user 
						in the bookshelf and as a splash page when loading a publication. There is no way to provide
						alternative text or a description for the image, but reading systems typically provide
						title and author information in the bookshelf to ensure that readers can access their
						publications.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 2</h4>
					
					<p>EPUB 2 similarly provides the ability to identify the cover image, but through the package
						document metadata:</p>
					
					<pre id="epub2-ex01" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;meta name="cover" content="manifest_cover_id" /></code></pre>
					
					<p>In this case, the <code>content</code> attribute references the ID of the manifest <code>item</code>
						for the image. (Note that this practice is not officially part of the EPUB 2 specification, but is
						recognized by EPUB 2 reading systems.)</p>
					
					<p>As with EPUB 3, there is no way for authors to make these images accessible.</p>
