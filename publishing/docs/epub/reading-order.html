				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Do reading systems hide non-linear content from readers when paging through a publication?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No, the EPUB specification does not mandate a specific way of rendering non-linear content,
							so you cannot rely on reading systems hiding content marked as non-linear. If you place a
							non-linear document between two chapters, some users will encounter that content as they
							manually page through the publication.</p>
						<p>Although some reading systems will ignore non-linear documents, only rendering them if a
							user clicks on a link to them, such behaviour is not universal.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<section id="order">
					<h4>Spine Order</h4>
					
					<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem"><code>spine</code> element</a> in the
						EPUB package document defines the order of documents in the publication. Reading systems use
						the element to determine which document comes next when users are reading.</p>
					
					<p>The <code>spine</code> consists of one or more <code>itemref</code> elements, each of which
						references an item in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-manifest-elem">manifest</a>.
						The <code>idref</code> attribute on the <code>itemref</code> provides the specific ID of manifest
						item to render, as depicted in the following example. (Note there is no hash (#) at the start of
						the reference as the value is an ID reference not a URL.)</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-expl-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;package &#8230;>
   &#8230;
   &lt;manifest>
      &#8230;
      &lt;item id="c01"
            href="xhtml/chapter01.xhtml"
            media-type="application/xhtml+xml"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/manifest>
   &lt;spine>
      &#8230;
      &lt;itemref idref="c01"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/spine>
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					
					<p>The average reader is typically not aware that an EPUB publication is usually a set of many
						documents in the spine. The reading system hides this fact from them, as when they reach the
						end of one document, it automatically propagates the next page by inspecting the
						<code>spine</code> to load the next.</p>
					
					<p>It is critical that you reference all the primary content documents from the <code>spine</code>,
						and you must order these documents to present the primary narrative of the publication in
						logical sequence. Although misorderding documents is not common, it can happen during edits and
						revisions (e.g., if you insert a new chapter or section). In these cases, all readers will be
						confused if the documents are out of sequence, or if one is missing, so it is more of a general
						usability issue than specifically an accessibility one.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="linear">
					<h4>Linear Content</h4>
					
					<p>Linear content documents are those that the author expects users to read sequentially: Chapter 1
						is followed by Chapter 2, which is followed by Chapter 3, and so on. The linear reading order
						represents the primary pathway through a publication.</p>
					
					<p>If readers are expected to read linear documents in sequence, then it follows that they are not
						required to read non-linear documents that way. An answer key is an example of a non-linear
						document. The reader might want to review it after the chapter containing the corresponding
						quiz, they might want to wait until the end of the book before checking the answers, or they
						might not be interested in it at all. It is not essential to read the answers where the author
						has inserted them into the spine, in other words.</p>
					
					<p>Non-linear content documents are identified by adding a <code>linear</code> attribute with the
						value <code>no</code> to the <code>itemref</code> element, as depicted in the following
						example:</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-expl-02-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;itemref
    idref="answers-01"
    linear="no"/></code></pre>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="linear-note-01">
						<p id="linear-note-01" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>Reading systems assume that <code>itemref</code> elements without a <code>linear</code>
							attribute represent linear content documents, so it is rare to find
							<code>linear="yes"</code> set in EPUB publications.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>The placement of non-linear content in the <code>spine</code> does pose some issues for the
						readability of the content. Because reading systems do not all handle non-linear content the
						same way, authors cannot assume how reading systems will present it to users. Reading systems
						may or may not present such content where it is placed in the <code>spine</code>.</p>
					
					<p>Consequently, a primary consideration for non-linear content is to ensure that its nature
						and purpose is clear on its own. Do not assume that readers will have followed a link to reach
						the non-linear content, so will already know its purpose.</p>
					
					<p>Using the example of an answer key, make sure that the file starts with a heading that
						identifies that what follows are the answers to the quiz. If you place image descriptions in a
						separate non-linear file, ensure that each description makes clear what image it is
						describing.</p>
					
					<p>Another option for non-linear content is to place it where it will have the least impact on the
						linear reading experience. You can place image descriptions and pop-out images after all the 
						linear content in the spine, for example (see <a href="#ex-02">example 2</a>). Placement at the
						end of the <code>spine</code> is particularly useful when you cannot adequately describe the
						content. An enlarged version of an image might suffer from an explicit caption, for
						example.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="linear-note-02">
						<p id="linear-note-02" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>EPUB 3's requirements for non-linear content differ from EPUB 2's in one significant way,
							namely authors must include a link to all non-linear documents in the spine. This
							requirement ensures that readers can reach the non-linear content regardless of whether
							reading systems render it while manually paging through a publication.</p>
						
						<p>In most cases, this requirement is not onerous to meet, as authors typically do not include
							non-linear content that they have not linked from the linear content. One known issue
							involves including a non-linear cover in the spine (see <a href="#ex-01">example 1</a>). To
							satisfy the linking requirement to this document, you can include a link to the cover in
							the <a href="../navigation/landmarks.html"><code>landmarks nav</code></a>.</p>
