				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Should an alternative link to the remote file be inside the <code>audio</code> or
						<code>video</code> element?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Fallback content inside the <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> elements is only
							accessible to users when the reading system does not support the element (e.g., in an EPUB
							2 reading system because there was no <code>video</code> element in XHTML 1.1).</p>
						
						<pre id="ex-faq-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;audio &#8230;>
   &lt;p>Sorry, your reading system does not support
      the audio element. The audio file cannot be
      played.&lt;/p>
&lt;/audio></code></pre>
						
						<p>Content inside the elements is not accessible if the reading system cannot download a
							resource or play the provided format. In these cases, the reading system displays its own
							error message (i.e., it does not display the internal fallback content).</p>
						
						<p>While it might seem helpful to provide a link to the web-hosted file inside the element,
							since it gives users with older reading systems access, it limits the availability in other
							situations. If a modern reading system cannot access the file, for example, a link anyone
							can access allows provides greater flexibility.</p>
						
						<p>Never place accessible alternatives, such as transcripts, inside these elements.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-002">Can I host my remote audio/video on YouTube?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Yes and no.</p>
						<p>If you want to link users out to an audio or video file on the web, you can host it on any
							site you want. There are no restrictions in EPUB on where external hyperlinks can go.</p>
						<p>If you are trying to embed a YouTube page in the EPUB via the HTML <code>iframe</code>
							element, then the answer is no. For security reasons, EPUB does not allow the embedding
							of web pages directly in a publication. The exemption that allows publishers to host remote
							video files outside the EPUB container only applies to video files; it does not apply to
							web pages that embed videos.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Although the issues with remote resources are primarily usability ones &#8212; they affect all users
					equally &#8212; they are not exclusively so. This section reviews how to include remote resources
					in an EPUB as well as how to mitigate both the usability and accessibility issues that can
					arise.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="epub2-note">
					<p id="epub2-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>EPUB 2 did not allow remote resources. The guidance in this section does not apply to that
						version of the EPUB format.</p>
				</div>
				
				<section id="res">
					<h4>Resources allowed remotely</h4>
					
					<p>EPUB 3 only allows you to host four types of resources outside of the EPUB container (i.e, the
						zip file that contains the publication):</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Audio</li>
						
						<li>Video</li>
							
						<li>Resources retrieved by scripts (e.g., using the JavaScript XmlHttpRequest and Fetch APIs).</li>
							
						<li>Fonts</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In the case of audio and video, the exemption only applies to files with a corresponding media
						type (e.g., <code>audio/mp3</code> for an MP3 file). You cannot reference an HTML page that
						embeds an audio or video player (e.g., YouTube).</p>
					
					<p>Do not confuse remote resources with external hyperlinks. A remote resource is one that is
						brought into the publication as opposed to a hyperlink that sends users out to the web. The
						<code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> elements allow you to embed audio and video
						resources regardless of where the referenced file is located, for example, while a hyperlink
						to YouTube will send a user to that web site.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="identify">
					<h4>Identifying remote resources</h4>
					
					<p>Although remote resources are not included in the EPUB container, you still must list them as
						publication resources in the EPUB manifest. The full URL to the resource goes in the manifest
						entry's <code>href</code> attribute.</p>
					
					<p>In addition, the EPUB content document that references the remote resource must have a
						<code>properties</code> attribute with the value "<code>remote-resources</code>" (this property
						allows reading systems to, for example, selectively enable remote access only for files that
						need it).</p>
					
					<p>The following example shows the manifest entries for a remote MP3 file and the XHTML
						file that embeds the audio (the file <code>c01.xhtml</code> would contain an <code>audio</code>
						element as depicted in <a href="#ex-01">example 1</a>).</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ident-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;package &#8230;>
   &#8230;
   &lt;manifest>
      &lt;item id="audio01"
            href="https://example.org/audio/war_of_the_worlds.mp3"
            media-type="audio/mp3"/>
      
      &lt;item id="c01"
            href="xhtml/c01.xhtml"
            media-type="application/xhtml+xml"
            properties="remote-resources"/>
      &#8230;
   &lt;/manifest>
   &#8230;
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					
					<p>When adding remote resource URLs to the manifest, be aware that you must escape any ampersands
						(&amp;) in the string. For example, if the URL has a query string with multiple parameters, you
						will have to encode each ampersand using the &amp;amp; entity as in the following example.</p>
					
					<pre id="ex-ident-02-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>Font URL:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto<strong>&amp;</strong>display=swap

Manifest encoding:
&lt;item id="font01"
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&amp;amp;display=swap"
      media-type="font/ttf"</code></pre>

				<section id="usability">
					<h4>Usability considerations</h4>
					
					<p>The most common reason for hosting resources remotely is due to their size. If a publication
						has several videos amounting to a few gigabytes of data, it may not be feasible to distribute
						such a publication. Vendors could reject the publication due to size restrictions, and even
						if they accept such large publications, users have to wait for all the data to download before
						they can begin reading, even if they have no interest in watching the videos.</p>
					
					<p>Hosting resources remotely is a way around size restrictions and defers the downloading of 
						some resources until they are needed, but it also comes with some serious usability issues &#8212;
						users will need a device with an active internet connection and a reading system that does not
						block access to the internet. Just because you have a tablet with an internet connection, for
						example, does not mean that the reading system will allow publications to retrieve resources
						from the web, as these could present security issues.</p>
					
					<p>Fonts are one of the best candidates for remote hosting as users will typically not notice their
						absence. When fonts are not available, the reading system automatically falls back to the next
						available font. The publication text may not appear as nicely as intended, but its readability
						generally does not suffer (with one exception detailed in the next section on <a 
							href="#a11y">accessibility concerns</a>).</p>
					
					<p>Before hosting audio and video outside the EPUB container, consider the user experience when
						they are not available. If they are critical to understanding the text, users without access
						will miss essential information.</p>
					
					<p>To mitigate some support and connectivity issues in reading systems, try offering users a way to
						link directly to the audio or video file (refer to <a href="#ex-01">example 1</a>. This may
						allow users to circumvent their reading system to try opening the content directly in a
						browser.</p>
					
					<p>Script data hosted outside the EPUB container is the most problematic type of remote resource
						from a usability perspective. Not only is support for scripting not universal in EPUB, but
						reading systems that support scripting may not support the APIs that allow you to call external
						data. In other words, a reading system that might allow remote audio and video might not allow
						remote script calls.</p>
					
					<p>For remote data calls, consider embedding a default data set if the external scripting call is
						only to get the latest version of the data. This will at least allow users to interact with the
						scripted content rather than have a non-working application in their publication.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="a11y">
					<h4>Accessibility considerations</h4>
					
					<p>Although the issues with remote resources are primarily usability ones, there is at least one
						case where the accessibility of a publication could be affected. If you use specialized fonts
						to aid reading (e.g., for to help users with dyslexia track the text), remotely hosting the
						fonts could make the publication less accessible to its intended audience. In this case, any
						benefit from remotely hosting the font is likely not worth the risk.</p>
					
					<p>For audio and video resources, following accessible production practices can help
						mitigate some of the inconvenience that arises when reading systems cannot retrieve them.
						Providing transcripts for audio and video, for example, allows users access to the information
						they would have provided.</p>
