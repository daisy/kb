						<p>The accessibilty tree is a representation of a web document created by browsers that is
							optimized for navigation by <a role="doc-glossref" href="#at">assistive technology</a>.</p>

						<p>The accessibility tree is essentially a modified version of the <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="h.html#html">HTML</a>
							<a role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#dom">DOM</a>. It includes additional information, such
							as accessible names and descriptions, and also omit some unnecessary information that is
							only useful for visual <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#render">rendering</a>.</p>

						<p>Ace is an accessibility checking tool for <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub-pub">EPUB
								publications</a> developed by the <a role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#daisy">DAISY
								Consortium</a>.</p>

						<p>Ace checks publications for common <a role="doc-glossref" href="w.html#wcag">WCAG</a>
							violations that can be detected by machine and generates a report on its discoveries.</p>

						<p>More information about the tool is available from the <a

						<p>The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification addresses the problem of
							making modern script-heavy web applications accessible for users of <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#at">assistive technologies</a>. These applications often do not use the built-in
							HTML elements, like buttons, in their interfaces, but turn otherwise static content, like
							images, into objects that users can click on to perform actions. While this is done to make
							the interfaces more visually appealing, prior to ARIA the scripting necessary to make these
							features work were not reflected in the <a role="doc-glossref" href="#a11y-tree"
								>accessibility tree</a>. The result was to make such interfaces impossible to use.</p>

						<p>ARIA addresses this problem by defining <a href="r.html#roles-states-props">roles, states and
								properties</a> so that the static elements can be presented like their more natural
							counterparts (e.g., a role of button can be assigned to an image so that assistive
							technologies can make it interactive).</p>

						<p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA specification</a> for more
							information.</p>

						<p>An assistive technology (AT) is a device or software program capable of <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#render">rendering</a> content in ways that facilitate
							reading by persons with disabilities.</p>

						<p>An assistive technology may be fully integrated into a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="r.html#rs">reading system</a> or may work in conjunction with hardware and
							software to provide a reading experience better tailored to the reader's preferred modality
							(e.g., screen-reading software like JAWS and NVDA, content zooming technologies and
							refreshable braille displays).</p>

						<p>The person or organization directly responsible for creating a digital publication and
							ensuring the quality and accessibility of the final product.</p>

						<p>In the context of digital publication specifications and documentation, the "author" does not
							refer to the person who wrote a publication. It is used to avoid personal pronouns
							(specifically "you"), as personal pronouns make translation to other languages more
							complex.</p>
