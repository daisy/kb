						<p>Any book produced in an digital format is an ebook. Ebooks may be created in EPUB, Microsoft
							Word, PDF, text, MOBI or a wide variety of other formats.</p>

						<p>Due to the book-centric nature of the term, it is almost never used in standards development.
							"Ebook" formats are often just as capable of being used for journals, articles and
							magazines, but the name detracts from these uses. The term <a href="d.html#digital-pub"
								>digital publication</a> is more commonly used to refer any type of publication in a
							digital format.</p>

						<p>EPUB is a distribution and interchange format for <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="d.html#digital-pub">digital publications</a>. It provides the ability to
							represent, package and encode structured and semantically enhanced Web content &#8212; including
								<a role="doc-glossref" href="h.html#html">HTML</a>, <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="c.html#css">CSS</a>, <a role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#svg">SVG</a> and other
							resources &#8212; for distribution in a single-file <a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container"
								>container</a>.</p>

						<p>EPUB was originally developed by the <a role="doc-glossref" href="i.html#idpf">IDPF</a>, but
							is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/epub3/">EPUB 3 Community
								Group</a> in the <a role="doc-glossref" href="w.html#w3c">W3C</a></p>

						<dfn>EPUB 2</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB 2 was the first version of <a href="#epub">EPUB</a> introduced in 2007.</p>

						<p>EPUB 2 used <a role="doc-glossref" href="x.html#xhtml">XHTML 1.1</a> as the markup standard
							for content, but notably omits support for the modules that provide interactive and
							server-side functionality (i.e., scripting, forms, events and server-side maps).</p>

						<p>EPUB 2 was quickly succeeded by <a role="doc-glossref" href="#epub3">EPUB 3</a> due to its
							many limitations (poor styling support, limited accessibility features, rudimentary support
							for international languages, etc.).</p>

						<p>A format called the Open Ebook Publication Structure was the predecessor to EPUB 2.</p>

						<p>Refer to the <a href="https://idpf.org/epub/201/">EPUB 2 specification</a> for more
							information.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="epub-3">
						<dfn>EPUB 3</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB 3 is the current version of <a role="doc-glossref" href="#epub">EPUB</a>. It succeeded
								<a href="#epub2">EPUB 2</a> in 2011 and moved the format to <a href="x.html#xhtml5"
								>XHTML5</a> and <a role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#svg">SVG</a> for representing
							content.</p>

						<p>EPUB 3 is also the successor to the <a role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#daisy-format">DAISY 3
								format</a> as it provides improved accessibility in a format the publishing industry
							already supports.</p>

						<p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/">EPUB 3 specification</a> for more

						<dfn>EPUB Content Document</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB content document is the generic name used for either an <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="x.html#xhtml">XHTML</a> or <a role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#svg">SVG</a>
							document that conforms to the requirements of the <a role="doc-glossref" href="#epub"
								>EPUB</a> specification.</p>

						<p>Although an <a href="#publication">EPUB publication</a> appears like a single document when
							read, the content is typically broken up into many separate content documents inside the <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container">container</a>. A feature of the <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="p.html#package-doc">package document</a> called the <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#spine">spine</a> defines the order to present the
							content documents in, giving the illusion of a single seamless document.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="epub-navigation-document">
						<dfn>EPUB Navigation Document</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB navigation document is a special document in an <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#publication">EPUB publication</a> that provides the main navigation aids (e.g.,
							the table of contents, <a role="doc-glossref" href="p.html#pagelist">page list</a> and <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="l.html#landmarks">landmarks</a>).</p>

						<p>The document is primarily intended to for use by <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#rs"
								>reading systems</a>. When a user clicks a button to open a table of contents, for
							example, the information in that table of contents has been read from the navigation
							document.</p>

						<p>It is possible to reuse the EPUB navigation document in the content of an EPUB publication,
							but in this case the document appears like any other HTML document.</p>

					<dt id="epub-style-sheet">
						<dfn>EPUB Style Sheet</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB 3 intially defined a baseline set of <a href="c.html#css">CSS</a> that <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#author">authors</a> were encouraged to use and <a
								href="r.html#rs">reading systems</a> to support under the name of "EPUB Style
							Sheets".</p>

						<p>This naming caused confusion, however, as it was sometimes misunderstood that EPUB was
							defining its own version of CSS. As a result, the name is no longer used in the EPUB
							specifications and has been replaced by more general references to CSS.</p>

						<p>Any reference to "EPUB Style Sheet" should be read as synonymous with "CSS Style Sheet".</p>

					<dt id="epub:type">
						<dfn>epub:type</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><code>epub:type</code> is the name of an attribute introduced in <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#epub3">EPUB 3</a> to provide <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="s.html#semantic-inflection">semantic inflection</a> (the ability to add additional
							information about the purpose of elements).</p>

						<p>It is used with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-ssv/">EPUB Structural
								Semantics Vocabulary</a> to enhance the markup in <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#contentdoc">EPUB content documents</a>.</p>

						<p>Although initially hoped that the attribute would provide a bridge between publisher in-house
								<a role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#semantics">semantic markup</a> needs and
							accessibility, the attribute never gained traction for accessibility and is no longer
							recommended for this purpose.</p>

							knowledge base for more information.</p>

						<p>Epubcheck is a validation tool that inspects EPUB files for problems. Among other things, it
							reports fatal errors that can prevent a file from opening, general errors that can lead to
							the content not working as expected, and it also issues warnings about practices that are
							not recommended.</p>

					<dt id="escapable">
						<dfn>Escapable</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Escapability refers to the the ability for non-visual readers to leave the current structure
							that is being read and continue reading at the next logical spot.</p>

						<p>A table is an example of an escapable structure, as assistive technologies provide the
							ability "escape" from the current table cell and move to another (or even to exit the table
							entirely and continue reading from what follows).</p>

						<p>Lists are another example of escapable structures, as users of assistive technologies are no
							more interested in reading every list item in some lists than any other reader.</p>
