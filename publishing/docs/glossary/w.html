						<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is a member-driven organization that develops open web
							standards. Their mission is "to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing
							protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web".</p>

						<p>With the merger of the <a role="doc-glossref" href="i.html#idpf">IDPF</a>, W3C is now the
							home for development of <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub">EPUB</a> as well as future
							web-based publishing initiatives.</p>

						<p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/mission/">W3C mission statement</a> for
							more information.</p>

						<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG, pronouned wuh-cag) are a set of guidelines
							developed by the <a role="doc-glossref" href="#w3c">W3C</a> that establish the criteria web
							content need to meet and exceed to be accessible to a broad audience of users.</p>

						<p>WCAG is not a checklist of markup practices, but a set of four principles for accessible
							documents: that they be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. Each of these four
							principles is divided into specific success criteria to evaluate a document against (e.g.,
							that all non-text content have text equivalents and that content can be zoomed without
							having to be scrolled).</p>

						<p>>Each of the success criteria is assigned a conformance level of A, AA or AAA. Level A is the
							baseline that documents have to achieve, and does not provide a high level of accessibility
							(i.e., some users will still have difficulty reading the document).</p>

						<p>Level AA is the level most often cited in accessibility legislation, as content that meets
							this level will be usable by users with a wide variety of reading needs.</p>

						<p>Level AAA is the highest level a document can achieve, but is considered more of an
							aspirational goal than a practical one (i.e., some success criteria simply cannot be met by
							some types of content). <a role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#author">Authors</a> should try
							to achieve any level AAA success criteria they can, but meeting them all is not
							expected.</p>

						<p>Informative guidance on how to meet each of the success criteria is provided in a separate <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">techniques document</a> and there is
							also a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/">guide to understanding
								WCAG</a>.</p>
