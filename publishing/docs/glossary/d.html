						<p>The DAISY Consortium is a global consortium of organizations committed to the common vision
							of ensuring that that information and knowledge is accessible to all. The Consortium's
							mission is to develop global solutions for accessible publishing and reading. (See the <a
								href="https://daisy.org/about-us/governance/vision-mission/">DAISY Consortium's Vision
								and Mission</a> for more information.)</p>

						<p>The DAISY Consortium has played a key role in the development of <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="e.html#epub">EPUB</a> &#8212; not only in the authoring of the standard itself,
							but also in the development of major projects such as the <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="e.html#epubcheck">epubcheck validation tool</a>, the <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="a.html#ace">Ace accessibility checker</a>, <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#rs"
								>reading system</a> accessibility reviews, and development of best practices.</p>

						<dfn>DAISY Format</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a role="doc-glossref" href="#daisy">DAISY Consortium</a> was originally formed to
							develop a talking book standard for readers with print disabilities. Two versions of the
							format, <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/daisy-2/">DAISY 2</a> (built
							on <a role="doc-glossref" href="x.html#xhtml">XHTML</a> and <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="s.html#smil">SMIL</a>) and <a
								href="https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/daisy-3/">DAISY 3</a> (built on a
							custom XML grammar and SMIL), are still widely produced.</p>

						<p>The DAISY Consortium no longer develops a separate talking book standard as <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub">EPUB 3</a> includes accessibility features that
							allow <a role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#author">authors</a> to create a single format that
							can be accessible to a wide range of user needs. EPUB 3 is considered the successor format
							to DAISY 3.</p>

						<dfn>DIAGRAM</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Digital Image and Graphic Resources for Accessible Materials (DIAGRAM) project was
							originally undertaken to make image and graphic content more accessible by defining a
							content model for writing descriptions and including alternate representations.</p>

						<p>The mandate of the project has since been increased and the <a
								href="http://diagramcenter.org/">DIAGRAM Centre</a> now provides tutorials and best
							practices not only for producing accessible image content but also for math content and for
							accessible publishing in general.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="digital-pub">
						<dfn>Digital Publication</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The term digital publication is used to refer to a publication in a digital format without
							having to refer to a specific format.</p>

						<p>Using the term digital publication avoids the baggage of content-specific names, like "<a
								role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#ebook">ebook</a>". Publications are not just books, but
							magazines, comics, audiobooks, articles, business documents or anything else that can be
							published digitally.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="dom">
						<dfn>Document Object Model</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The document object model, or DOM, is the structure produced when a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="u.html#ua">user agent</a> (e.g., a reading system or browser) processes the markup
							in a web document. The DOM is typically likened to a tree of branches, where each branch
							represents the parent/child relationships of all the elements in the source document.</p>

						<p>The DOM is what allows scripts to operate on web documents &#8212; to change the styles of
							elements, to add or remove content, etc. &#8212; as the information about the document is
							stored in an abstract and language-independent way.</p>

						<p>For more information about the DOM, refer to the <a
								href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"
									><abbr title="Mozilla Developer's Network">MDN</abbr> article <cite>Introduction to
									the DOM</cite></a>.</p>
