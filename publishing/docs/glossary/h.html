						<p>HTML is the markup language used to produce documents on the Web.</p>

						<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML specification</a> also defines an XML-based
							way of writing HTML documents called <a role="doc-glossref" href="x.html#xhtml"
							>XHTML</a>.</p>

						<dfn>HTML5</dfn>

					<dd>
						<p>HTML5 was the version of <a role="doc-glossref" href="#html">HTML</a> introduced by the <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="w.html#w3c">W3C</a> as the successor to HTML 4.01.</p>

						<p>The name HTML5 has caused confusion since its inception, however, as what was published as
							HTML5 was in fact modified snapshots of work being done by a group of browser makers,
							leaving the web community with two similar standards for the same thing, one versioned and
							one not.</p>

						<p>An agreement has since been reached to stop the dual process of standardizing HTML. As a
							result, only a single <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML specification</a> is now
							published without a specific version number.</p>

						<p>As HTML5 was the last versioned number to exist, it is still commonly used to refer to the
							standard, but there is no technical difference between saying HTML5 and HTML anymore. Both
							refer to the evolving standard.</p>
