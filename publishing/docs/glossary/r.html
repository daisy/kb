						<dfn>Reading System</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Reading system is the generic term used in <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub">EPUB</a>
							to describe the application used to read or process a publication.</p>

						<p>A reading system can be a dedicated device like an eInk tablet, or could be an application
							like Kobo Books, Google Play Books and Apple iBooks, that runs in a tablet, phone or on a
							computer.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="remote-res">
						<dfn>Remote Resource</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub3">EPUB 3</a>, a remote resource is a <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="#resource">resource</a> that is hosted on the Web instead of
							being included inside the <a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container">ZIP container
								file</a>.</p>

						<p>Audio, video and fonts are examples of resources that are allowed to be located on the web.
							The reason this is allowed is to speed up the download time of the publication, so users can
							begin reading faster.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="render">
						<dfn>Render</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Render is a presentation-neutral term used to describe how a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#rs">reading system</a> makes a <a role="doc-glossref" href="p.html#publication"
								>publication</a> readable for a user.</p>

						<p>For visual reading, for example, rendering entails the visual lay out and styling of the
							content on a screen. For auditory reading, rendering involves playing back pre-recorded
							audio or generating <a role="doc-glossref" href="t.html#tts">text-to-speech</a>
							playback.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="rendition">
						<dfn>Rendition</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub3">EPUB 3</a>, a rendition of a publication is one
							presentation of its content.</p>

						<p>All publications consist of one default presentation, but it is technically possible for more
							than one presentation to be bundled together. For example, a digital publication could have
							separate English and French versions, or a fixed layout and reflowable version for readers
							to choose from.</p>

						<p>In practice, however, renditions are more theoretical than practical at this time. A means of
							selecting between possible renditions was developed for EPUB 3, but has never gained any
							traction either with publishers or <a role="doc-glossref" href="#rs">reading system</a>
							developers.</p>

						<p>A rendition is not the same things as its possible <a href="#render">renderings</a>. Each
							rendition could be rendered multiple ways (e.g., visually, aurally, tactilely)</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="resource">
						<dfn>Resource</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Resource is a generic term used to refer to anything used in the rendering of a <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#digital-pub">digital publication</a>. Resources include
							the files in a <a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container">container</a> or anything that
							can be obtained from the web.</p>

						<p>Although it might be simpler to think of resources as "files", the word file is generally
							avoided because publication resources may not exist until they are retrieved (e.g., a script
							might dynamically generate a resource to return to a <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#rs"
								>reading system</a>).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="roles">
						<dfn>Roles, States and Properties</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The three major components of the <a role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#aria">ARIA</a>
							specification are the definition of roles, states and properties for making interactive
							content accessible.</p>

						<p><em>Roles</em> identify the purpose that an element serves so that <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="a.html#at">assistive technologies</a> understand how to make the content usable.
							For example, the role <code>button</code> could be assigned to a <code>span</code> element
							to indicate that is has been scripted to function like a clickable button. An assistive
							technology can then make that element clickable by the user even though it normally wouldn't
							be.</p>

						<p><em>States</em> are used to keep track of changes to an element as users interact with it.
							For example, if an element has been assigned the role <code>checkbox</code>, assistive
							technologies need to know if the checkbox is in a checked or unchecked state. States are
							managed by scripts as they change.</p>

						<p><em>Properties</em> represent attributes of an element. They are similar to states, but
							typicaly less likely to change. A button can be assigned a name using either the
								<code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attributes, for example.
							Similarly, a slider might set its minimum and maximum value properties using the
								<code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> properties.</p>

						<p>Taken together, roles, states and properties allow developers to emulate built-in HTML
							elements (like <code>button</code> and <code>input</code>) and also make many common
							scripting patterns more easily usable for users of assistive technologies.</p>
