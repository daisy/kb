				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Should content lists be included in the EPUB navigation document?</dt>
					<dd><p><em>Only if the navigation document is included in the spine.</em></p>
						<p>Although these lists are an ideal for the navigation document, EPUB reading systems typically
							only provide access to the table of contents and sometimes the page list. This is true despite
							the EPUB specification requiring that there be some way to access all the content of the
							navigation document. Consequently, readers will not be able to access the lists when the
							navigation document is not in the spine.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="faq-002">Do I need to use the <code>epub:type</code> attribute?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Only if the lists are included in the navigation document. These values can help a reading
							system determine the purpose of the list, although there is no known use of them at this
							time. Only the <a href="toc.html"><code>toc</code></a>, <a href="pagelist.html"
								><code>pagelist</code></a> and <a href="landmarks.html"><code>landmarks</code></a>
							values are typically ever recognized.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Print publications have long included lists of figures, tables and illustrations as a way to quickly
					relocate this information. Readers often skip this information when reading the primary narrative
					in order not to lose their train of thought, only returning to it after completing the work or
					the chapter that contained the item.</p>
				
				<p>Visual readers have an advantage in being able to quickly visually skim for such content, but
					relocating this content can be time consuming and challenging for those using assistive
					technologies or who have cognitive difficulties.</p>
				
				<p>When creating a content list, use the HTML <code>nav</code> element and provide a meaningful
					title for the list. Also, ensure that each entry in the list meaningfully describes the content
					that is linked to (e.g., do not use simple labels like "Figure 1" without any further context).</p>
				
				<p>Digital publications are not limited to lists of traditional two-dimensional content as are found
					in print. Lists of audio, video and interactive content can also be included when a publication
					contains this type of content.</p>
