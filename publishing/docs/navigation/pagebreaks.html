				<figure id="ex-01">
					<figcaption>
						<div class="label">Example 1 &#8212; Page break marker (inline)</div>
						<p>An empty <code>span</code> element identifies a page break inside a block element. It
							is identified as a page break using the <code>role</code> attribute with the value
							<code>doc-pagebreak</code>. The <code>aria-label</code> attribute provides a
							pronounceable value.</p>

				<figure id="ex-02">
					<figcaption>
						<div class="label">Example 2 &#8212; Page break marker (block)</div>
						
						<p>A <code>div</code> element identifies a page break where inline elements are not allowed.
							This example shows an example of a page number that is intended to be visible in the
							content.</p>
						
						<p>(Note that the <code>aria-label</code> is currently required even when the number is visible.
							A future version of the DPUB-ARIA module is expected to fix this so that the page number
							is automatically obtained from the content of the element when a label is not specified.)</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-pb-001">What if the order of my ebook doesn't exactly match the order of the print
						equivalent?</dt>
					<dd><p>It is sometimes the case when converting to digital that front and back matter
						material gets shuffled around and/or omitted. These changes in content order are not
						unexpected, and users will understand that their ebooks may not be formatted exactly
						the same way as the print, and may not include all the print content.</p>
						<p>Do not renumber the page break markers to be sequential when the digital order is
							different from the static source. Their purpose is to help users locate the static
							equivalent location.</p>
						<p>If some content is ordered differently in the digital version, or not included, best
							practice is to make note of this in the <a 
								href="../metadata/schema-org.html#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>
							for the publication.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-002">Does the page number reflect the page that is ending or the page that is
						starting?</dt>
					<dd><p>The page number always reflects the page that is starting.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-003">Should the page break marker placement follow the print position?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, page break markers are always placed at the start of the page's content,
						regardless of whether the page number is printed at the top or bottom of the page in
						the print edition. When a user jumps to a specific page, they want to jump to the start
						of the content for that page, not the end.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-004">Should I include the page numbers as content or empty elements?</dt>
					<dd><p>There are pros and cons to each approach.</p>
						<p>If you include the page numbers as text content within a <code>span</code> or 
							<code>div</code>, the pages will be more easily accessible to both sighted users
							and users using assistive technologies. This method has been employed in previous
							DAISY standards. The potential downside, however, is that mainstream user agents
							will not provide equivalent functionality to turn off unwanted content, forcing
							users to hear and view the page numbers.</p>
						<p>Page numbers as empty elements are the more traditional mainstream approach, with
							anchor tags having served this function in the past. Using the 
							<code>aria-label</code> attribute on an empty element, however, limits the users
							who will have access to the page number while reading.</p>
						<p>Although user agents don't support toggling the visibility of page numbers, it is
							possible to provide the functionality using JavaScript. A script could be included
							in each document to show/hide the numbers.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-005">Should I use the <code>aria-label</code> or <code>title</code>
						attribute for the page number?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The use of <code>aria-label</code> is recommended when the page number is not
							included as text content, but both attributes can be used. <code>aria-label</code>
							has higher precedence than <code>title</code> in the <a 
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">accessible name computation 
								algorithm</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-006">Where do I put a page number when the page break occurs in the middle
						of a list?</dt>
					<dd><p>Lists often break across pages, with one item ending at the bottom of one and a new
						item starting at the top of the next. In these cases, it is not possible to locate the
						page number between the two list items, as it is not valid for a list to contain
						anything but list items.</p>
						<p>The obvious solutions are to either insert the page number as the very last element
							in the item that ends the page:</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;. &lt;span role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="24"/>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&#8230;&lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>or to place it as the very first element in the list item that starts the page</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="24"/> &#8230; &lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>One practice to avoid is creating a new list item just for the page break. As page
							breaks are often not visible content, an empty list item will be confusing to all
							users and may alter the meaning of the list.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-007">Where do I put the page break if a word is hyphenated across a
						page?</dt>
					<dd><p>Place the page marker after the word. Do not retain the print hyphenation and insert
						the number in the middle of the word.</p></dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-009">Can I put the page break inside a heading?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>No, do not put page breaks inside headings. If you do this, the page number will
							become part of the accessible name for the section (i.e., it is calculated as part
							of the text content of the heading).</p>
						<p>Put the page break number before the heading tag. If you are using an empty element for the
							page break (i.e., the value is in a <code>title</code> attribute as in <a 
								href="#ex-01">example 1</a>), moving the page break before the heading will not add
							add extra space to the layout.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt id="faq-pb-008">Can I use <code>a</code> tags for page numbers?</dt>
					<dd><p>The <code>a</code> element has two specific uses defined in HTML5: for links when
						the <code>href</code> attribute is present, and for placeholder links when it is not
						(e.g., a link that might be active in another context or after some interaction by the
						user). As page breaks are not links, and are never intended to be activated as links,
						it is not recommended to use them for page break markers.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>If a digital publication is produced from the same workflow as a print document, page break
					locations should be retained. Retaining the page break locations, together with providing a
					<a href="./pagelist.html">page list</a>, can allow assistive
					technologies and reading systems to announce the current page users are on and also allow users
					to move forward or backward by page.</p>
				
				<p>Page break locations can be added to the markup using <code>span</code> and <code>div</code>
					tags with a <code>role</code> attribute set to the value <code>doc-pagebreak</code>.</p>
				
				<pre id="expl-pb-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;div role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg2">2&lt;/div></code></pre>
				
				<p>To hide the page number from visual
					viewing, the <code>aria-label</code> attribute can be used to identify the number.</p>
				
				<pre id="expl-pb-02-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg5" aria-label="5"/&gt;</code></pre>
				
				<p>The <code>id</code> attribute on the page break allows linking to the location from the page
					list.</p>
				
				<p>Although page breaks have traditionally been retained for accessibility purposes (i.e., to allow
					users who must use a digital version to coordinate with those using print), it is becoming
					more common to find them as a general user aid. Digital-only publications (i.e., that do not
					have a statically paginated source), often include page break markers to make it easier for
					users to coordinate their position.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="epub2-pb-note">
					<p id="epub2-pb-note" class="label">Note</p>
					
					<p>In EPUB 2, it is not possible to include a semantic that identifies page break locations in
						the content, as XHTML 1.1 does not support either the ARIA <code>role</code> or
						<code>epub:type</code> attributes.</p>
