				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>For many users, the primary or only way they can interact with content is via a keyboard or
					keyboard-like input device (e.g., voice recognition software, virtual keyboards). It is imperative
					for these users that all functionality be operable by keyboard.</p>
				
				<p>The most common cause of keyboard interoperability issues is when authors add custom scripted
					controls and links to their pages. Using HTML-native elements such as buttons, sliders and
					hyperlinks generally avoids keyboard input pitfalls. In these cases, authors only need to ensure
					that the controls are created accessibly &#8212; for example, that they are clearly labeled and
					grouped according to their purpose.</p>
				
				<p>For custom controls, authors need to ensure that their creations meet all the same requirements
					as native controls. Some examples include:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>that users are able to reach the control;</li>
					<li>that the purpose of the control is clear;
					<li>that the control is operable by keyboard; and</li>
					<li>that users do not get trapped in the control.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>When creating custom controls, it is also important to consider the effects of shortcut keys on
					their ability to use a publication. It may seem like a convenience to sighted readers to assign
					single-key printable character (letters, numbers, punctuation) as a shortcut for an operation, but
					readers trying to enter commands may have their input intercepted. The result may be that the user
					cannot complete a necessary function or may potentially activate an unwanted action in the content.
					Authors must always allow users to remap or turn off single-character shortcuts.</p>
				
				<p>It is also important to not cause changes of context when focus changes to the element (e.g., the
					user tabs to it). Changing the context, such as opening a new window, submitting a form, or
					altering the content, can cause confusion for readers who cannot see what has occurred.</p>
				
				<p>Similarly, entering input into a field or changing the setting of a control must not cause an
					unexpected change of context.</p>

					<p>The keyboard requirement for Level A conformance excludes functionality where the full path of
						movement is essential, not just the start and end points. A program that allows a user to drag
						an object and drop it, for example, is not excluded because the path to the destination does not
						matter. A drawing program, on the other hand, would be exempt because full path affects the
						drawn object.</p>
