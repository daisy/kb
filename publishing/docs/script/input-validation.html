				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Filling out forms presents several challenges for users, from ensuring they have specified all
					required fields to ensuring all fields have been filled in correctly. When fields are missed or
					errors occur, it is not always easy for users with disabilities to locate the problems or determine
					what needs to be fixed.</p>
				
				<section id="timing">
					<h4>When to Validate</h4>
					
					<p>When user input is used solely by a digital publication, data validation occurs on the page that
						is requesting the data.</p>
					
					<p>It is only when the author attempts to send data to an external web application that server-side
						validation may occur. But in these cases, the author will most likely use a scripting API like
						XmlHttpRequest and report errors without refreshing the page. Forms typically cannot be
						directly submitted to a web server without spawning a new window, as the return page will not
						be recognized as a resource of the publication.</p>
					
					<p>This document consequently only reviews methods for validating and reporting errors from within
						a digital publication. For more information about handling errors in a page returned from
						a web application, see the Web Accessibility Tutorial on <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/">User Notifications</a>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="built-in">
					<h4>Built-in Checks</h4>
					
					<p>The best option for validating input is to use the mechanisms built into HTML.</p>
					
					<p>The <code>required</code> attribute, for example, is available on most form input elements. It
						provides a programmatic means of identifying which fields a user must fill in (sighted users will
						still require a visual cue).</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-01">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Identifying a required field</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;select
    name="birth-month"
    required="required">
   &lt;option value="">Month&lt;/option>
   &#8230;
&lt;/select></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>When the <code>required</code> attribute is set, users cannot submit the form in reading systems
						that support forms until the fields are completed. The reading system will alert them that
						required information is missing if they try.</p>
					
					<p>The <code>pattern</code> attribute allows authors to specify a regular expression to validate
						the input against. This attribute is useful when the input must match a specific form.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-03">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Pattern matching two comma-separated numbers in parentheses</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-03-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    pattern="([0-9]{1,4}, *[0-9]{1,4})"
    &#8230; /></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>Authors can also use the <code>placeholder</code> attribute to provide a hint to the expected
						value, which is especially useful when specific patterns are expected. Note, however, that this
						value disappears once the user begins to input their data, so it should not be used in place of
						a proper label or description for the field.</p> 
					
					<figure id="ex-08">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Hinting at the expected input</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-08-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    placeholder="(#,#)"
    pattern="([0-9]{1,4}, *[0-9]{1,4})"
    aria-label="Starting coordinate"
    &#8230; /></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The <a href="autocomplete.html"><code>autocomplete</code> attribute</a> provides another
						potential measure of ease for ensuring that users input the right information. Setting this
						attribute allows users to automatically insert saved form data.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-04">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Identifying an autocomplete field</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-04-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    autocomplete="given-name"
    &#8230; /></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The drawbacks of this attribute for publishing are that most forms do not collect user
						information, they are generally for testing, plus application-based reading systems do not
						store previously submitted data for reuse. The attribute may only work with reading systems
						that run in browsers for limited information.</p>
					
					<p>There are also attributes for specifying minimum and maximum values,
						minimum and maximum numbers of characters to input, and for using a regular expression to verify
						the text input by a user.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-02">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Specifying minimum and maximum values</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-02-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    type="range"
    min="1"
    max="100"
    &#8230; /></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The <code>type</code> attribute on the <code>input</code> element is often overlooked for
						validation, but it allows authors to identify that the input represents a common field like a
						phone number or email address.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-09">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Email input field</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-09-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    type="email"
    &#8230; /></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>These specialized input types often include their own built-in validation. For example, user
						agents will check that the user has input a valid email address when an email field is
						specified. Using these built-in types avoids the need to write complex and redundant pattern
						checks for generic text input fields.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="locate">
					<h4>Locating Input Errors</h4>
					
					<p>Although using the built-in validation mechanisms allows reading systems to handle informing
						users when there are errors, it is not possible to use these mechanisms for all data
						validation. When validating custom data fields, it is necessary to make the process of finding
						and fixing the errors as easy as possible for users.</p>
					
					<p>A common approach to manual validation is to write a list of input errors in a visually
						distinct, and clearly labelled, box at the top of form. While this technique is generally fine,
						to help users with assistive technologies, the element containing the errors should be marked as
						a live region using the ARIA role <code>alert</code>. This allows them to announce the new text
						when it is written to the element.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-05">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Creating a live region</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-05-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;div
    role="alert"
    aria-labelledby="errors">
    &lt;h6 id="errors">
       Errors Processing Form
    &lt;/h6>
    &lt;p>The following items did not validate:&lt;/p>
    &lt;ul>
       &#8230;
    &lt;/ul>
 &lt;/div></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>JavaScript alert boxes should be avoided as the sole means for listing errors, as once the
						dialog is closed the user typically loses access to the list. For users with cognitive and
						learning disabilities, remembering multiple fields that need to be corrected can be
						difficult.</p>
					
					<p>A better option would be to limit the alert to notifying the user that the submission
						contained errors that need fixing and direct them to the list on the page when the dialog
						closes.</p>
					
					<p>When listing the errors, it helps to provide links to the invalid fields.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-06">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Linking to invalid field</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-06-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;p>The following items did not validate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
   &lt;li>&lt;a href="#postcode">Invalid postal
      code entered&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
   &#8230;
&lt;/ul></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>For digital publications, it is often a better option to validate user input as it is entered.
						This will avoid having to add and remove dynamic lists of errors.</p>
					
					<p>While invalid fields should, of course, be visually identified so that visual
						users can locate them as they review the data, ARIA includes the <code>aria-invalid</code>
						attribute for programmatically marking the invalid fields.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-11">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Using ARIA to identify errors</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-11-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;input
    id="address"
    name="address"
    type="text"
    required=""
    aria-invalid="true"/>
</code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>Setting the <code>aria-invalid</code> attribute allows assistive technologies to easily move
						users to the fields that are in error so they are not reliant on a list of errors or having to
						manually traverse every field in the form to find out what failed.</p>
					
					<p>When users fix the errors, make sure to update or remove the <code>aria-invalid</code>
						attribute. (Be aware that setting <code>aria-invalid=""</code> means that the field is
						<strong>not</strong> invalid.)</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="describe">
					<h4>Describing Errors</h4>
					
					<p>In addition to locating errors, users also benefit from explanations of why fields are marked
						invalid. The ARIA <code>aria-errormessage</code> allows authors to link a description of the
						issue to the invalid field.</p>
					
					<figure id="ex-12">
						<figcaption>
							<p class="label">Example &#8212; Using ARIA to identify error messages</p>
						</figcaption>
						<pre id="ex-12-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;div id="postcode" class="error">
   &lt;label for="address">
      Postal Code:
   &lt;/label>
   &lt;input
       id="address"
       name="address"
       type="text"
       required=""
       error-invalid="true"
       aria-errormessage="post-err"/>
   &lt;span id="post-err"
       aria-live="alert">
      Postal code must be of the
      form A1A 1A1.
   &lt;/span>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The <code>aria-errormessage</code> is similar in function to <code>aria-describedby</code>
						but more clearly indicates that the attached description explains the issue. (Note that
						<code>aria-errormessage</code> is only allowed on an element when <code>aria-invalid</code> is
						also used on it.)</p>
					
					<p>The <code>aria-live</code> attribute can also be set on the error message so that it gets
						announced to users when it is added (see the <a href="#ex-12">preceding example</a>). If
						individual error fields are identified this way, it is not recommended to also alert users when
						adding a full list of issues (i.e., it will cause users to hear all the errors twice).</p>
					
					<p>While it may only be possible to tell the user that the data they input is invalid in some
						cases, if the specific reason their data is invalid can be determined it is better to be as
						precise as possible in the error message. The more information you can provide users, the
						easier it will be for them to correct the error.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="confirm">
					<h4>Confirming Submissions</h4>
					
					<p>Ensuring that form data validates to the author's expectations does not mean users have input
						the information they intended to. A user may not notice a typo when inputting information, for
						example, or a field may accidentally change without their noticing (e.g., hitting arrow keys
						can sometimes accidentally change selection box and radio button choices).</p>
					
					<p>Providing users the option to review their data before submitting it is a helpful way to ensure
						that the information matches their expectations, especially as a detailed review of form data
						in its raw form can be challenging for all users.</p>
					
					<p>Providing confirmation is a level AA requirement for test data, so educational publishers need
						to be aware when the success criterion applies to tests and quizzes they embed in a digital
						of having to fix data for users, or allow them to undo and resubmit, which is covered in 
						<a href="#revert">the next section</a>.</p>
					
					<p>It is often difficult to provide this sort of independent validation within a digital
						publication, however, because it requires dynamically writing the information into the same
						page as the form, which not all reading systems support well. Similarly, using a JavaScript
						alert may work for very small data sets, but quickly becomes unwieldy to read for large data
						submissions.</p>
					
					<p>If the author knows users will be able to submit a form directly to their server (i.e., the
						reading system will open a new browser window to submit the data rather than send the data
						through a JavaScript API), a confirmation page could be provided on the server side. This
						option is generally only available in select cases where the reading systems that users have
						access to is limited.</p>
					
					<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="review-note">
						<p id="review-note" class="label">Note</p>
						<p>Data that stays exclusively within the digital publication is often less critical to review
							than data sent to an external source, as the potential harm to users from mistakes tends to
							be less significant. For example, it is less critical to review a practice exam marked
							within a digital publication than to review course exercises submitted to a school's
							servers.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section id="revert">
					<h4>Reverting Submissions</h4>
					
					<p>As mentioned in the last section, it is much better to allow users to review their data before
						submitting it than to provide options for reverting and correcting.</p>
					
					<p>This is especially true with digital publications, as the means of retrieving and fixing data
						are complicated by the restrictions of the format. Persisting information within a digital
						publication is not easy, for example, as storage options are limited (i.e., users cannot easily
						come back later to undo a form submission if they close the publication). Similarly, network
						issues can lead to data being submitted but the publication not receiving confirmation of
						submission, preventing users from undoing.</p>
					
					<p>Authors should strongly consider other options for collecting information if it is necessary
						to allow users to revert submissions. For example, whenever possible, direct users to a form
						outside the publication to collect information rather than embed the form.</p>
					
					<p>Reverting and correcting submissions may only be realistically done through an external web site
						that can confirm the user's identity if submissions must occur through a digital publication.
						For example, a course portal could provide the option to revert or fix mistakes rather than
						trying to accomplish this through the publication itself.</p>
