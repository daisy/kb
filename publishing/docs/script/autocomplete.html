				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>Setting the HTML <a 
					href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#attr-fe-autocomplete"><code>autocomplete</code> 
					attribute</a> on form fields simplifies the comprehension and
					completion of these fields for users with cognitive and physical disabilities.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="tech">
				<h3>Techniques</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Add the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute to form fields that match any of the preset values. [[WCAG-1.3.5]]</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Examples</h3>
				
				<figure id="ex-01">
					<figcaption>
						<div class="label">Example 1 &#8212; Autocomplete for a telephone number</div>
						<p>The following example shows three fields for inputting a telephone number: one for the
							area code and one each for the local number. The purpose of each field is identifiable
							from its <code>autocomplete</code> attribute.</p>
					</figcaption>
					<pre id="ex-01-src" class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;fieldset
   &lt;label>Telephone:&lt;/label>
   (&lt;input type="text" autocomplete="tel-area-code" id="area-code" aria-label="Area code"/>)
   &lt;input type="text" autocomplete="tel-local-prefix" id="local-prefix" aria-label="Local number prefix"/> -
   &lt;input type="text" autocomplete="tel-local-suffix" id="local-suffix" aria-label="Local number suffix"/>
&lt;/fieldset></code></pre>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt id="faq-001">Why isn't the input label sufficient?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Input labels for the same information differ site-to-site and language-to-language making
							them unreliable for machine processing. The controlled keywords for the
							<code>autocomplete</code> allow user agents and assistive technologies to determine the
							purpose without having to parse language and spelling peculiarities.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Although not as common in reading systems as in web browsers, saving personal information allows
					user agent to automatically fill it in the next time the user encounters the same field. A
					publication may ask for this type of information in the context of an educational program
					or to sign up to receive updates from the publisher.</p>
				
				<p>To provide this functionality, the user agent needs to understand the information the user inputs as
					well as when it is relevant to use again. The <a 
						href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#attr-fe-autocomplete"><code>autocomplete</code> 
						attribute</a> is the key to this machine understanding. It allows authors to assign a precise
					machine-readable semantic to form fields so that the user agent understands where what information
					goes in what field.</p>
				
				<p>The HTML definition of the attribute includes the list of semantics that are available. The
					semantics cover such information as names, addresses, birth dates, and telephone numbers. The WCAG
					documentation also provides a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#input-purposes">condensed list
						of the values</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Using the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute makes forms simpler to complete for users with
					cognitive and physical disabilities as they do not have to re-enter the same information again and
					again each time they are asked for personal information.</p>
				
				<p>Using these semantics also allows user agents to augment comprehension in other ways. For example,
					they could add a standard visual cue (an icon such as a telephone or birthday cake) to further help
					users understand each field's purpose.</p>
