				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>A <dfn>colorDependent</dfn> access mode indicates that color is the sole means of conveying some visual 
					information. It is expressed in metadata using the <code>colorDependent</code> value.</p>
				
				<p>As <code>colorDependent</code> describes a characteristic of visual content, it is considered
					a modifier of the <a href="visual.html"><code>visual</code> access mode value</a> and you should
					always pair the two values together.</p>
				
				<p>A common example of the need to perceive color occurs with graphs and charts. If the bars in
					a graph, or the slices in a pie chart, are differentiated by color alone, then users may
					not be able understand the data unless they can perceive those color differences.</p>
				
				<p>Color dependence can also manifest itself in other ways, such as when learning assignments
					are color coded to age or difficulty level, or when hyperlinks are colored to indicate
					their purpose (e.g., to open external web sites).</p>
				
				<p>The application of the <code>colorDependent</code> value only applies to the visual reading
					experience and the value is not set if a secondary means of differentiating the information
					is available. If, for example, graphs and charts include distinct patterns in their data
					representations, such as lines going in different directions, then a user can use those
					patterns to differentiate the data. Similarly, hyperlinks can use different types of underline
					to gives a visual cue to their existence and purpose.</p>
				
				<p>Note, however, that any secondary means of differentiating the information must also be visual
					before this label can be omitted. Affordances provided for non-visual readers, such as through
					hidden ARIA attributes, are not generally accessible to visual readers so do not improve the
					accessibility for them.</p>
				
				<p>The <code>colorDependent</code> value is meant to help individuals with, for example, color
					blindness and cognitive disabilities determine if the content will be accessible to them.
					Whether affordances are provided that non-visual readers to access visual presentations is
					declared through the <a href="../accessModeSufficient.html">sufficient access modes</a>.</p>
				
				<p>A colorDependent access mode is common in publications produced using the EPUB format but is 
					less common for audiobooks. It is only potentially relevant when an audiobook also contains
					supplementary material beyond the audio.</p>
