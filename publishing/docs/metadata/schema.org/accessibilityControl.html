				<h3>Note on Use</h3>
				
				<p><strong>The use of this property in digital publications is discouraged at this time.</strong></p>
				
				<p>The issue of compatibility with user input methods is complicated by the many combinations of
					reading systems, operating systems, and assistive technologies that exist for ebook reading. It is
					not easy to determine whether content will work across all these combinations.</p>
				
				<p>Authors may use the property, for example, if their content is distributed and consumed on a limited
					number of platforms for which they can reasonably test conformance.</p>
				
				<p>To ensure publications with scripting are as accessible as possible, always follow the requirements
					outlined in <a href="../../conformance/wcag.html">WCAG</a>.</p>
