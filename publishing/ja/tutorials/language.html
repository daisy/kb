				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>Setting the language of a publication is an important step in ensuring its accessibility as it helps
					assistive technologies pronounce the text correctly. Without language declarations, assistive
					technologies will read the text in the default language of the user. This can lead to the entire
					text being mispronounced (when reading a publication in another language) or individual phrases
					being mangled (for inline foreign phrases).</p>
				
				<p>This tutorial covers how to set the language in the EPUB package document as well as
					in XHTML content documents so that the information is available to assistive technologies
					and reading systems.</p>

				<h3>What are language tags</h3>
				
				<p>Before we can get into the mechanisms for setting the language, it is important to first understand
					what you are setting. Languages are declared using <dfn>language tags</dfn>, which are hyphen-separated
					codes that identify the language, region, script, etc.</p>
				
				<p>At a minimum, each language tag consists of a primary language, which is a two- or three-character code
					that identifies the language.</p>
				
				<p>The following table lists some common language codes:</p>
				
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Code</th>
							<th>Language</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>de</td>
							<td>German</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>en</td>
							<td>English</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>he</td>
							<td>Hebrew</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>hi</td>
							<td>Hindi</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>ko</td>
							<td>Korean</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>For the complete list of language codes, refer to the <a 
					href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">IANA
					language registry</a> (search for the language's name to find its code).</p>
				
				<p>For many languages, all that you have to specify is the primary language code. For others with
					regional dialects, however, you can add an additional region subtag for more precision.</p>
				
				<p>American and British pronounciations, for example, can differ significantly, but a code of
					"<code>en</code>" will not inform an assistive technology which to apply when it matters (e.g.,
					when reading an American or British novel where the characters talk in regional dialects). Adding
					the region solves this problem as it allows the assistive technology to pick a more appropriate
					voice for playback.</p>
				
				<p>The region subtag is added to the language using a hypen. For example, "en-US" indicates that
					the text is in English as spoken in the US.</p>
				
				<p>The following table lists some common language tags with their region subtags:</p>
				
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Code</th>
							<th>Language</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>en-UK</td>
							<td>British English</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>en-US</td>
							<td>US English</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>fr-CA</td>
							<td>French as spoken in Canada</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>en-FR</td>
							<td>French as spoken in France</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>Note that although it is common convention to capitalize region tags, this is not a requirement.
					Language tags are processed case-insensitively.</p>
				
				<p>It is not necessary to use region codes for metadata such as that found in the <a
					href="#package-lang">EPUB package document</a>. This information is rarely region-specific
					and users will typically expect to hear it announced in their preferred regional dialect.</p>
				
				<p>You can also specify the script the text is written in using a script subtag. Simplified and
					traditional Chinese, for example, can be differentiated using the "zh-Hans" and "zh-Hant" script
					tags. You should only use script subtags when a language is commonly written in more than one
					script.</p>
				
				<p>For a more in-depth explanation of language tags, refer to the W3C article <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/#extlang">Language tags in HTML and
					XML</a>.</p>

				<h3>Language declaration mechanisms</h3>
				
				<p>With an understanding now of what language tags are, it is time to turn to how to express those tags
					in markup languages.
				
				<p>In XML-based markup languages, like XHTML, SVG and the EPUB package document, the standard mechanism
					for declaring the language of the text is the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute, where the value of
					this attribute is a language tag.</p>
				
				<p>Best practice is to always declare a language on the root element (i.e., the element that contains
					all the other markup). For example, the language of an XHTML document can be specified as follows:</p>
				
				<pre class="example prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en-US">
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
				
				<p>Language information is inherited, so by setting the attribute on the root element you automatically
					declare language information for all the elements and text in the document.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="html-lang-note">
					<p id="html-lang-note" class="label">Note on HTML</p>
					
					<p>Although it is only required to use the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute with XHTML documents, it
						is best practice to also add a <code>lang</code> attribute. When doing so, the language tag
						expressed in the <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>lang</code> attributes must match. For
						example:</p>
					
					<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html &#8230; xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"></code></pre>
					
					<p>The reason why it is recommended to add both attributes is that the XHTML documents in EPUB
						publications may not always be processed as XML, despite the requirements of the standard. A
						browser-based reading system might, for example, default to processing all the XHTML documents
						as regular HTML. In this case, the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute is ignored, as HTML
						processors only recognize the <code>lang</code> attribute. By always adding both attributes,
						you help ensure that the correct language information is available to users regardless of how
						the document is processed.</p>
