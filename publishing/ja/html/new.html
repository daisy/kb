				<h3>Overview</h3>
				
				<p>Tracking changes to the HTML standard has become more difficult complicated since it changed to a
					"living standard". The standard does not have a change log listing major changes; it instead refers
					readers to the entire list of changes made in the standard's issue tracker. Although there is a
					twitter account that tweets changes to the standard, even this is difficult to track now that
					tweets appear out of order &#8212; plus not every change is relevant to publishers of digital
					publications.</p>
				
				<p>This page will try to bring to fill this information void by drawing attention to any major changes
					to the standard that are likely to impact publishers.</p>
				
				<p>Due to the ever-changing nature of the HTML standard, this page may not always be perfectly in sync.
					If you are aware of a recent change that should be noted, please open an issue to have it
					highlighted.</p>

				<h3>Changes</h3>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>March 23, 2023 &#8212; The <code>search</code> element added</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The new <code>search</code> element is a dedicated container for a search box. It fills a
							semantic gap that the <code>nav</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, and
							<code>aside</code> elements missed.</p>
						<p>Although the element is unlikely to be used inside publications, it may be beneficial for
							identifying search interfaces in web-based reading systems.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 1, 2022 &#8212; Outline algorithm removed; <code>hgroup</code> redefined</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The outline algorithm has been fully removed from the HTML standard. The notion of the
							sectioning of a document defining its outline, regardless of the headings used, has now
							been put to rest.</p>
						
						<p>This change should only re-affirm best practices for structuring documents, as the outline
							algorithm has never worked in practice.</p>
						
						<p>In removing the outline algorithm, the <code>hgroup</code> element has undergone a major
							transformation. It is now designed to group a heading with its subheadings in a
							semantically improved manner. The <code>hgroup</code> tag now allows only one heading tag
							for the heading and can include subheadings in <code>p</code> tags. (This change will make
							the DPUB-ARIA <code>doc-subtitle</code> role unnecessary moving forward.)</p>
						
						<p>For more information about using <code>hgroup</code>, please refer to the Knowledge Base's
							<a href="./headings.html">headings page</a>.</p>
