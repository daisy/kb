				<p>PLS lexicons provide control over the text-to-speech (TTS) playback rendering on conforming reading
					systems. A lexicon file is like a dictionary or look-up guide, allowing the pronunciations defined in it
					to be used in place of the default rendering when matching words are encountered. Defining words in a
					lexicon ensures that readers hear your work played back as expected, not based on the heuristics applied
					by the TTS engine on their reading system.</p>

				<p>Each PLS lexicon is an XML file with a root <code>lexicon</code> element. Lexicons are comprised of one or
					more <code>lexeme</code> entries, each of which defines the word(s) to match in <code>grapheme</code>
					element(s) and the replacement pronunciation to use in a <code>phoneme</code> element. (See <a
						href="#ex01">Example 1</a>.)</p>

				<p>The <code>alias</code> element can also be used to replace one word with another. (See <a
						href="#ex05">Example 5</a>.)</p>

				<p>The language of the lexicon and the phonetic alphabet used must both be defined on the root
						<code>lexicon</code> element.</p>

				<p>PLS entries should be created for any complex word that is important to the publication and that a TTS
					engine is likely to mispronounce. The list includes, but is not limited to, proper names and nouns,
					technical, scientific and legal terms, and complex compound words. The default rendering for heteronyms
					can also be defined in a PLS lexicon so that only variations need to be handled by SSML tagging.</p>

				<p>Note that PLS lexicons are not activated simply by being included in the EPUB container. You must
					reference the applicable lexicon(s) from each content document in order for them to be applied to the
					content. The <code>hreflang</code> attribute should also always be set to the language of the referenced
					PLS file. (See <a href="#ex06">Example 6</a>.)</p>

				<p>Multiple lexicons can be attached to a content document to handle embedded foreign languages. (See <a
						href="#ex07">Example 7</a>.)</p>

				<p>Localizations are not possible within a single PLS lexicon file, but you can attach multiple lexicons to
					voice words differently for different regions. (See the <a href="#faq4">faq question</a> below for
					more information.)</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Are lexicons supported at this time?</dt>
					<dd><p>At the time of writing, no reading systems have appeared that support the new TTS enhancements in
							EPUB 3. Please send a report if the situation changes and this page has not been
						updated.</p></dd>
					<dt>Should I use IPA or X-SAMPA or something else to write my pronunciations?</dt>
					<dd><p>Although IPA is arguably the most widely recognized phonetic alphabet, that does not mean that it
							has full support even in existing synthetic speech engines. Some engines support only their own
							alphabets, for example. IPA is also less developer-friendly than X-SAMPA because it uses Unicode
							characters that require modifying most keyboard layouts to input, whereas X-SAMPA is ASCII-based.
							Internal workflows should be a determining factor at this time. The ultimate answer will depend
							on what engines are employed in reading systems.</p>
						<p>Note that it is possible to translate one alphabet representation to the other, so work in either
							alphabet shouldn't ever be <q>lost</q> if there does turn out to be a clear winner and loser.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Are lexicons case sensitive?</dt>
					<dd><p>The need to be able to define case-sensitive pronunciations is clear, but how PLS lexicons are
							processed less so. The specification itself says nothing about case sensitivity of graphemes,
							with only a requirement for case-sensitive processing defined in an <a
								href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/#AppC">informative appendix</a>. Until
							reading systems that support PLS lexicons appear, any answer is speculative, but assume case
							sensitivity because of the critical role it plays. </p>
						<p>Note that you should also consider that certain terms will appear both in lower case and title
							case in a publication without changing the pronunciation, and add <code>grapheme</code> elements
							for both cases:</p>
						<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;lexeme>
   &lt;grapheme>acetaminophen&lt;/grapheme>
   &lt;grapheme>Acetaminophen&lt;/grapheme>
   &lt;phoneme>@"sit@'mIn@f@n&lt;/phoneme>
&lt;/lexeme></code></pre>
						<p>When case conflicts occur, use SSML in the markup to correct the pronunciation of the less common
							term. For example, both spellings <q>mobile</q> and <q>Mobile</q> may refer to human mobility in
							a document that studies age-related health issues in Mobile, Alabama. Defining the pronunciation
							of <q>Mobile</q> as <q>ˈmoʊbaɪl</q> will cause the city name to be mispronounced (and likewise
							the other way around).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Are there any dangers in mixing languages?</dt>
					<dd><p>Yes, if the rendering engine does not support voicing the specified language, the reader may get
							an error or the text may be silently skipped. Error handling in such situations cannot be
							guaranteed. Language-specific lexicons will typically not be loaded.</p></dd>
					<dt>Can I add localizations?</dt>
					<dd><p>Not within a single PLS file. The <code>phoneme</code> element does not allow an
								<code>xml:lang</code> to be attached to it. Multiple localized lexicons could be attached to
							a content document that only specifies the stem language code, so that the reader's localization
							preference setting can be used to determine the proper lexicon to apply (e.g., the content
							document specifies it is <code>en</code> and the lexicons specify <code>en-US</code> and
								<code>en-GB</code>).</p>
						<p>Care should be taken not to exclude readers by specifying localizations. If a reading system does
							not include a voice that can handle the localizations, the lexicon will not be loaded.</p>
						<p>A better solution is to define one lexicon for all reading systems that can handle the
							region-independent language. If the publication is written in US English, for example, it would
							be better to use the default <code>en</code> code for the standard pronunciation lexicon and
							specify a locale only for targeted regions:</p>
						<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;html … xml:lang="en">
   &lt;head>
      &#8230;
      &lt;link
         rel="pronunciation"
         href="#lex/en.pls"
         type="application/pls+xml"
         hreflang="en" />
      &lt;link
         rel="pronunciation"
         href="#lex/en-GB.pls"
         type="application/pls+xml"
         hreflang="en-GB" />
      &#8230;
   &lt;/head>
   &#8230;
&lt;/html></code></pre>
						<p>This way any reader with an English-language reading system will at least hear the correct US
							pronunciations.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Should I use PLS lexicons or SSML?</dt>
					<dd><p>The inclusion of the technologies in EPUB 3 was not to require a choice to be made; the
							technologies are meant to complement each other. PLS lexicons allow you to define a word once and
							have the TTS engine do the work of replacing it each time it occurs in the prose. <a
								href="ssml.html">SSML</a>, on the other hand, provides the fine-grained control that is just
							not possible in a lexicon, at the price of having to tag each instance of a term that has to be
							replaced.</p>
